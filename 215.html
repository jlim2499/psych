Block randomisation is used in clinical trials to ensure that participants are evenly distributed across study arms, especially when recruitment occurs over time. This is important to maintain balance in group sizes, which enhances the comparability of groups and ensures statistical power. For example, if a trial recruits participants in waves, block randomisation ensures that no arm has disproportionately more or fewer participants at any point.<br/><br/><b>Reduce sampling error</b>: This is incorrect. Sampling error relates to variability between the sample and the population it represents. Block randomisation addresses balance in group allocation, not sampling error, which is better managed by increasing sample size.<br/><br/><b>Randomise clusters instead of individuals</b>: This is incorrect. Randomising clusters refers to cluster randomisation, a different method often used in trials involving groups (e.g., schools or GP practices). Block randomisation involves individuals rather than clusters.<br/><br/><b>Adjust for confounding variables</b>: This is incorrect. Adjusting for confounding variables is typically achieved through statistical techniques like regression analysis, not block randomisation. Block randomisation focuses on group balance, not variable adjustment.<br/><br/><b>Blind participants to treatment allocation</b>: This is incorrect. Blinding is a separate process designed to prevent participants or researchers from knowing the treatment allocation to reduce bias. Block randomisation does not inherently involve blinding.<br/></div>
