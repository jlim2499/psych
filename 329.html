A box and whisker plot, also known simply as a box plot, is used to graphically represent the distribution of a dataset. It displays the median, quartiles, and potential outliers within a dataset, making it an excellent tool for summarising the central tendency and variability of the data. The plot shows the interquartile range (IQR) as a box, with 'whiskers' extending to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5 times the IQR. Points outside this range are plotted individually as outliers. This type of plot is useful in clinical settings for visualising the distribution of patient measurements, such as blood pressure readings across different treatment groups.<br/><br/><b>Stem and leaf plot</b>: This type of plot also summarises a dataset, but it does so by splitting each data point into a 'stem' (the first part of the number) and a 'leaf' (the last digit). It is not suitable for displaying data in the format shown, as it doesn't effectively visualise the central tendency or variability of a dataset in the same way as a box and whisker plot.<br/><br/><b>Scatter plot</b>: A scatter plot is used to show the relationship between two continuous variables. Each point on the plot represents an observation in the dataset. This option is incorrect because the graph shown does not represent relationships between two variables but instead summarises a single variable's distribution across several samples.<br/><br/><b>Dot plot</b>: A dot plot uses dots to display the frequency of values in a dataset, with each dot representing one or more observations. While useful for small datasets, a dot plot would not summarise the data in the same way as a box and whisker plot, particularly when it comes to showing quartiles and outliers.<br/><br/><b>Histogram</b>: A histogram is used to show the distribution of a single continuous variable by dividing the data into bins and showing the frequency of data within each bin. Although histograms are useful for visualising the distribution of data, they do not provide the detailed summary statistics, such as the median and quartiles, that a box and whisker plot offers.<br/></div>
