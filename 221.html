On a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, the X-axis represents the false positive rate (1 - specificity). This measures the proportion of negative cases that are incorrectly identified as positive. The ROC curve plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) on the Y-axis against the false positive rate on the X-axis, providing a graphical representation of a test’s diagnostic performance across different thresholds.<br/><br/><b>True positive rate (sensitivity)</b>: This is incorrect. The true positive rate, also known as sensitivity, is plotted on the Y-axis, not the X-axis.<br/><br/><b>True negative rate (specificity)</b>: This is incorrect. Specificity is not plotted on the ROC curve. Instead, the X-axis shows 1 - specificity, representing the false positive rate.<br/><br/><b>Positive predictive value</b>: This is incorrect. Positive predictive value (PPV) is not represented on the ROC curve. PPV depends on the prevalence of the condition and is not directly related to the curve’s axes.<br/><br/><b>Negative predictive value</b>: This is incorrect. Negative predictive value (NPV) is also not represented on the ROC curve. Like PPV, NPV depends on prevalence and is not used in ROC analysis.<br/></div>
