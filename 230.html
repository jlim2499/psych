<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A researcher wants to investigate a drug's effect on a person's heart rate.  They hypothesise that the drug will speed up people's heart rates.  What type of hypothesis is this?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">One-tailed alternative hypothesis</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>One-tailed alternative hypothesis</b>. In scientific research, a one-tailed alternative hypothesis is used when the direction of the effect being investigated is predicted. In this case, the researcher hypothesises that the drug will speed up people's heart rates, so they are predicting a specific direction of effect, which fits with a one-tailed alternative hypothesis.<br/><br/>The first incorrect option is <b>Null hypothesis</b>. A null hypothesis posits that there will be no significant difference or relationship between variables - in other words, it suggests that any observed effect is due to chance. Here, however, the researcher is predicting an increase in heart rate as a result of taking the drug - not simply an absence of effect.<br/><br/>The second incorrect choice is <b>One-tailed null hypothesis</b>. This option is actually a misnomer; there's no such thing as a one-tailed null hypothesis. The null hypothesis always assumes no difference or effect regardless of direction, hence it cannot be 'one-tailed'.<br/><br/><b>Two-tailed alternative hypothesis</b> is another incorrect option. A two-tailed alternative hypothesis would be used if the researcher was interested in any change in heart rate (either increase or decrease) but had not predicted which direction this change would take. As our researcher has specifically predicted an increase in heart rate, this makes their hypothesis one-tailed rather than two-tailed.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>Two-tailed null hypothesis</b>, like 'one-tailed null hypothesis', doesn't exist and thus isn't correct. Again, a null hypothesis does not predict directionality and always posits no difference or effect; therefore it cannot be 'two' or 'one' tailed.<br/></div>
