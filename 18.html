Primary care patients with sub-threshold depression were assigned to minimal contact psychotherapy plus usual care (n=107) or to usual care alone (n=109).<br/><br/>Depressive symptoms were measured using the Centre for Epidemiological Studies  Depression scale (CESD; Radloff, 1977), Dutch version (Bouma et al, 1995), a widely used self-report scale measuring the frequency of 20 depressive symptoms during the past week. The CESD generates a total score that can range from 0 to 60, with a higher score indicating more depressive symptoms.<br/><br/>Results:<br/><br/>Primary care patients with sub-threshold depression benefited from minimal contact psychotherapy as it reduced the risk of developing a full-blown depressive disorder from 18% to 12%. <br/><br/>The ICER was calculated as (C1C0)/(E1E0), where C is the average annual per capita cost and E is the percentage of people who did not develop depression in the experimental and control conditions. In other words, ICER is the difference of mean costs between the conditions divided by the difference in effect. Substitution yields (67668614)/(88.181.7)=288.75. Hence, for each case of depression that can be avoided by offering the experimental treatment instead of care as usual, a saving is made of 288.75.<br/><br/>Conclusions:<br/><br/>Over 1 year adjunctive minimal contact psychotherapy improved outcomes and generated lower costs. <br/><br/><br/>What type of study has been conducted?<br/><br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Cost-effectiveness analysis</span></div><br/>Study details as follows:<br/><br/><i>Smit (2009) Cost-effectiveness of preventing depression in primary care patients<br/>Randomised trial. The British Journal of Psychiatry Mar 2006, 188 (4) 330-336.</i><br/><br/>The study compares the costs of two approaches to treating sub-threshold depression against improvements on a depression scale. This is an example of an cost-effectiveness analysis.<br/><br/>The big clue in the description is the ICER which is a statistic used in cost-effectiveness analysis.<br/></div>
