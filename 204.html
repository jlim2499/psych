<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>In which phase of clinical trials are drugs compared against others on the market in an attempt to get a license?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Phase III</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Phase III</b>. In Phase III trials, the new drug is compared against the current standard treatment or a placebo in large groups of people (typically hundreds to thousands) to assess its effectiveness and monitor side effects. This phase aims to provide a statistical proof of efficacy and monitor adverse reactions from long-term use. The results of this phase are often used in marketing applications for the new drug.<br/><br/><b>Phase I</b> trials primarily aim to determine the safety, dosage range, and side effects of a new drug or treatment. They involve a small number of healthy volunteers (about 20-80) and hence are not designed for comparison with other drugs on the market.<br/><br/><b>Phase II</b> trials involve larger groups of people (100-300) who have the condition that the new drug is designed to treat. These trials aim to determine efficacy and further evaluate safety but still do not compare the new drug with others on the market.<br/><br/><b>Phase IV</b>, also known as post-marketing surveillance, takes place after a drug has been approved for consumer sale. They involve thousands of participants and last for many years. These trials gather information about long-term risks, benefits, and optimal use - they may also compare this drug against others in the market but do not contribute towards getting a license as they occur after approval.<br/><br/><b>Phase V</b> does not exist in clinical trial phases - it's likely included here as an incorrect option based on misunderstanding or misremembering the correct order of phases. Clinical trials typically only include Phases I-IV.<br/><br/></div>
