<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A researcher collects blood pressure measurements on a group of people before and after a structured exercise session. The aim is to compare the mean blood pressure values before and after the exercise session. The data is normally distributed. Which of the following statistical tests is most appropriate to determine if there is a significant difference in the means?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Paired t-test</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Paired t-test</b>. A paired t-test is used to compare the means of two related groups when the data is normally distributed. In this case, the same group of individuals has their blood pressure measured before and after exercise, making the groups dependent. The paired t-test is ideal for determining if the exercise intervention caused a statistically significant change in blood pressure.<br/><br/>5 Steps:<br/><br/>1) Define the research question: The question aims to determine whether there is a difference in blood pressure values before and after exercise within the same group.<br/>2) Establish how many groups there are and if they are dependent or independent: There is one group with two related measurements (before and after exercise).<br/>3) Identify the variables and data types: The variable is blood pressure, which is continuous and measured on a ratio scale.<br/>4) Establish if parametric or non-parametric tests should be used: The data is normally distributed, allowing the use of a parametric test.<br/>5) Select the correct statistical test: A paired t-test is the correct test to compare means in dependent groups with normally distributed data.<br/><br/><b>Mann Whitney U test</b>: This test is a non-parametric alternative to the independent t-test, used for comparing two independent groups when the data is not normally distributed. It is inappropriate here as the groups (pre- and post-exercise measurements) are related.<br/><br/><b>Wilcoxon's rank sum test</b>: This is a non-parametric test for comparing two related groups when the data is not normally distributed. While it could be used for dependent groups, it is unnecessary in this case since the data is stated to be normally distributed.<br/><br/><b>Chi squared test</b>: The chi-squared test is used for categorical data to test for associations or differences in proportions. It is not suitable for comparing means of continuous data like blood pressure.<br/><br/><b>Unpaired t-test</b>: An unpaired t-test is used to compare the means of two independent groups. Since the data in this scenario comes from the same group measured twice, this test is inappropriate.<br/></div>
