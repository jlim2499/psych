<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following correctly matches the data type with its characteristic?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Continuous data – infinite number of possible values within a range</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Continuous data – infinite number of possible values within a range</b>. Continuous data can take any value within a given range, such as height, weight, or temperature. These values are measurable and can include fractions or decimals.<br/><br/><b>Qualitative data – measured on an interval scale</b>: This is incorrect. Qualitative data refers to non-numerical data describing characteristics or categories (e.g., gender, ethnicity), and it is not measured on an interval scale. Interval scales are used for numerical data.<br/><br/><b>Discrete data – values are not countable</b>: This is incorrect. Discrete data involves countable values, such as the number of children in a household or the number of hospital admissions.<br/><br/><b>Nominal data – has a natural order</b>: This is incorrect. Nominal data is purely categorical with no natural order, such as blood type or eye colour. Data with a natural order would be ordinal.<br/><br/><b>Ordinal data – purely categorical without any order</b>: This is incorrect. Ordinal data is categorical but has a meaningful order, such as pain severity scales (e.g., mild, moderate, severe).<br/></div>
