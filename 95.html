<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following examples demonstrates an indirect association?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Socioeconomic status influencing health outcomes through access to healthcare</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Socioeconomic status influencing health outcomes through access to healthcare</b>. This is an example of an indirect association because the relationship between socioeconomic status and health outcomes is mediated by a third variable, such as access to healthcare. The association is real, but it is not direct.<br/><br/><b>Alcohol consumption directly causing liver cirrhosis</b>: This is an example of a direct association, where alcohol directly damages liver cells, leading to cirrhosis. There is no intermediary variable mediating this relationship.<br/><br/><b>Asbestos exposure consistently associated with mesothelioma</b>: This is a direct association. Asbestos fibres cause cellular damage in the pleura, leading to mesothelioma without the involvement of a third variable.<br/><br/><b>Increased ice cream sales correlating with drowning deaths due to warm weather</b>: This is an example of a spurious association. The observed relationship is caused by a confounding variable (warm weather), not a true link between ice cream sales and drowning deaths.<br/><br/><b>Smoking directly causing lung cancer</b>: This is a direct association. Carcinogens in cigarette smoke directly damage lung tissue and DNA, leading to cancer without any intermediary factor.<br/></div>
