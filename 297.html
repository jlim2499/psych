<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is required to calculate the standard deviation?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Mean</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Mean</b>. The mean is required to calculate the standard deviation because the standard deviation measures the dispersion of data points from the mean.<br/><br/><b>Median</b>. This statement is incorrect. While the median is a measure of central tendency, it is not used in the calculation of the standard deviation. The standard deviation specifically requires the mean.<br/><br/><b>Range</b>. This statement is incorrect. The range is a measure of the spread between the highest and lowest values in a data set, but it is not used in the calculation of the standard deviation.<br/><br/><b>Mode</b>. This statement is incorrect. The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a data set. It is not used in the calculation of the standard deviation.<br/><br/><b>Confidence interval</b>. This statement is incorrect. The confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the population mean, and it is calculated using the standard error of the mean. It is not used to calculate the standard deviation.<br/></div>
