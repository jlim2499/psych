<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is true regarding the standard error of the mean?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">The standard error of the mean is always smaller than the standard deviation</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>The standard error of the mean is always smaller than the standard deviation</b>. The standard error of the mean (SEM) is a measure of how far the sample mean (average) of data is likely to be from the true population mean. It is calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the square root of the sample size. Because it involves division by a factor related to sample size, SEM will always be smaller than or equal to the standard deviation.<br/><br/><b>The standard error of the mean is the same as the standard deviation</b> - This statement is incorrect. As explained above, while both measures relate to variability in data, they are not identical. The SEM takes into account sample size and provides an estimate of uncertainty around a population mean.<br/><br/><b>The standard error of the mean increases as the samples get larger</b> - This statement is also incorrect. In fact, it's quite opposite: as sample size increases, SEM decreases because you're dividing by a larger number when calculating SEM.<br/><br/><b>The standard error of the mean is not affected by the sample size</b> - This statement contradicts what we know about SEM calculations. Sample size directly impacts SEM; as mentioned earlier, larger samples result in smaller SEMs because they provide more information about population variability.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>Unlike the standard deviation, the standard error of the mean is not in the same units as the data</b> - This statement isn't accurate either. Both SEM and SD are expressed in original units of measurement since they both deal with variability within a dataset.<br/></div>
