This can be particularly problematic for studies that measure changes over time within a group. If a group is chosen because of extreme characteristics, any subsequent measurement is likely to be closer to the mean, not necessarily due to any experimental intervention, but simply due to statistical tendency. This can lead to false assumptions about the effectiveness of an intervention, thereby affecting the study's internal validity, which is the extent to which a causal conclusion based on a study is warranted.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Face validity: Face validity refers to how well a test seems to measure what it purports to measure on the surface. It is not directly affected by regression towards the mean.<br/><br/>Criterion validity: Criterion validity is about how well one measure predicts an outcome based on another measure. While measurements can be affected by regression towards the mean, the validity itself is more about the relationship between different measures.<br/><br/>External validity: External validity pertains to the generalisability of the study's findings to the larger population. Regression towards the mean affects internal consistency and the study's own results, not necessarily the generalisability.<br/><br/>Construct validity: Construct validity relates to how well a test measures the concept it intends to measure. While regression towards the mean can affect the interpretation of results, it's more about the measurement's accuracy rather than the validity of the construct being measured.<br/></div>
