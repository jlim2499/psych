It can be used for people between the ages of 16 and 90.  For children there is a specific form called the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC).<br/><br/>The current version (WAIS-IV) consists of four index scores as follows:-<br/><br/><ul><li>	Verbal Comprehension Index</li><li>	Perceptual Reasoning Index</li><li>	Working Memory Index</li><li>	Processing Speed Index</li></ul><br/>Each index is comprised of a number of subsets<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid1"><thead><tr><th><b>Verbal comprehension subsets</b></th><th><b>Perceptual reasoning subsets</b></th><th><b>Working memory subsets</b></th><th><b>Processing speed subsets</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Similarities, vocabulary, information, comprehension</td><td>Block Design, matrix reasoning, visual puzzles, picture completion, figure weights</td><td>Digit span, arithmetic, letter-number sequencing</td><td>Symbol search, coding, cancellation</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>The results are presented as two scores:-<br/><br/><ul><li>	Full Scale IQ (based on the score of the four index scores)</li><li>	General Ability Index (based on scores from verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning</li></ul><br/>The average score is 100 with a standard deviation of 15 (85-115).  A score of 100 puts a person on the 50th centile (50% of people score above and 50% score below). It becomes less accurate at the extremes of IQ (70-130).<br/><br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mma077.png"/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/>As can be seen in the above distribution, approximately 3% of people will have an IQ less than 70 (the general cut-off for a significant learning disability.</div></div>
