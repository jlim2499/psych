According to the Kaplan-Meier survival curve shown in the graph, at day 80, approximately 75% of the participants in group A are still alive. The red line representing group A stays at 75% at the 80-day mark, as illustrated by the horizontal line at this point.<br/><br/><b>15</b>: This is incorrect because the survival percentage for group A at day 80 is much higher than 15%. The graph clearly shows that the survival rate is at 75%, not near the lower value of 15%.<br/><br/><b>25</b>: This is incorrect because it significantly underestimates the proportion of people still alive in group A. The survival rate at day 80 is much higher, standing at 75%, rather than 25%.<br/><br/><b>95</b>: This is incorrect because it overestimates the survival rate. The survival percentage for group A at day 80 is 75%, not close to 95%, as shown in the graph.<br/><br/><b>20</b>: This is incorrect because it is far below the actual survival percentage. The graph indicates that the survival rate for group A at day 80 is around 75%, not 20%.<br/></div>
