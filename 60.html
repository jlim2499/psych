<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Calculate the median value from the following values.<br/>1, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">5</span></div><br/>The median is the middle value. In this case there are 11 values so the point at which divides the set is 5. As you can see below, by identifying the median of 5 there are 5 values below and 5 values above it. Hence it divides the data set.<br/><br/>1,3, 3, 3, 4, <b>5</b>, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6<br/><br/>The modal (most common value) value would be 6<br/><br/>The mean value would be 4.36 which is equal to the sum of all the values divided by the number of values. <br/> <br/></div>
