In a negative skew the bulk of data is concentrated to the right of the figure and the left tail is longer (this is referred to as left skew).  In positive skew the opposite is true. <br/><br/>For skewed data the median is always positioned between the mode and the mean, because it is the halfway point.  The mode always corresponds to the peak of the distribution as it represents the most common value.  The mean however moves away from the median in the direction of the tail because of its tendency to be affected by extreme values (outliers).<br/><br/><ul><li>For normally distributed data - mode=median=mean</li><li>For positively (right) skewed data - mean&gt;median&gt;mode</li><li>For negatively (left) skewed data - mode&gt;median&gt;mean</li></ul></div></div>
