<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A study is performed to find the normal reference range for IgE levels in adults. Assuming IgE levels follow a normal distribution, what percentage of adults will have an IgE level higher than 2 standard deviations from the mean?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">2.5%</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>2.5%</b>. In a normal distribution, approximately 95% of the data lies within two standard deviations of the mean. This means that the remaining 5% of the data lies outside this range. Since the normal distribution is symmetrical, half of this 5% will be above two standard deviations and the other half below. Therefore, the percentage of adults who will have an IgE level higher than 2 standard deviations from the mean is 2.5%.<br/><br/><b>1.25%</b> is incorrect. This value represents half of the remaining percentage (2.5%) of one tail but does not correspond to two standard deviations above the mean.<br/><br/><b>1.96%</b> is incorrect. This value represents the z-score for 97.5% cumulative probability but not the percentage of data outside two standard deviations.<br/><br/><b>5%</b> is incorrect. This value represents the total percentage of data outside two standard deviations but not just the upper tail.<br/><br/><b>0.5%</b> is incorrect. This significantly underestimates the percentage of data above two standard deviations from the mean.<br/></div>
