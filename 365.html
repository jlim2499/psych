Variance measures the spread of a data set and is mathematically defined as the average of the squared differences from the mean. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and provides a measure of spread in the same units as the original data. Understanding this relationship is crucial in interpreting the variability of data in clinical and research contexts.<br/><br/><b>Variance is the square root of the standard deviation</b>: This is incorrect. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, not the other way around.<br/><br/><b>Variance equals standard deviation when the mean is zero</b>: This is incorrect. The variance and standard deviation are related by a mathematical formula that is independent of the value of the mean. The mean has no direct impact on whether variance equals standard deviation.<br/><br/><b>Standard deviation is variance divided by the mean</b>: This is incorrect. Standard deviation is derived by taking the square root of the variance, not by dividing it by the mean.<br/><br/><b>There is no relationship between variance and standard deviation</b>: This is incorrect. Variance and standard deviation are closely related; the standard deviation is the square root of the variance, making this relationship integral to understanding data dispersion.<br/></div>
