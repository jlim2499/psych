<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A randomised controlled trial compares two drugs used in the initial management of sexual dysfunction. After being assigned to the randomised groups a number of patients drop out due to adverse effects of the medication. <br/>How should the data be analysed?<br/><br/><br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Include the patients who drop out in the final data set</span></div><br/>Explanation for the Correct Answer:<br/><br/>Include the patients who drop out in the final data set: In a randomised controlled trial (RCT), the principle of intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis is considered the gold standard. According to this approach, patients are analysed in the groups to which they were randomised, regardless of whether they dropped out, fully adhered to the treatment protocol, or crossed over to another treatment arm. This method preserves the benefits of randomisation and avoids potential biases that could arise from excluding patients after randomisation. Therefore, the correct option is to 'Include the patients who drop out in the final data set'.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Recruit more patients: While recruiting more patients may be useful in maintaining power in a study where the dropout rate is high, it does not address the analysis of existing data and may introduce new variables.<br/><br/>For each patient who drops out, remove a patient from the other randomised group: This method, known as 'per-protocol' analysis, can lead to bias because it violates the principle of randomisation and can distort the treatment effect.<br/><br/>Remove patients who drop out from the final data set: Excluding patients who drop out of the study can lead to bias, as these dropouts are rarely random and may be related to the treatment or its side effects, thus affecting the validity of the study findings.<br/><br/>Abandon the trial if more than 5% of patients drop out: It is not practical or scientifically sound to abandon a trial based on a set percentage of dropouts without considering the context of the trial size, dropout reasons, and the statistical power of the study. Trials should be designed to account for an anticipated dropout rate, and decisions to stop a trial early should be based on interim analyses and pre-specified criteria.<br/></div>
