Torsades de pointes is a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that occurs in the context of QT interval prolongation. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication, is known to cause QT interval prolongation and hence can precipitate Torsades de pointes. According to the British National Formulary (BNF), haloperidol should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for QT interval prolongation including concurrent use of other medications that prolong the QT interval, heart disease, family history of sudden cardiac death and electrolyte imbalance.<br/><br/><b>Citalopram</b>, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), can also cause QT interval prolongation but it's less likely than haloperidol. The BNF advises that citalopram should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome or those on antiarrhythmic drugs.<br/><br/><b>Moclobemide</b> is a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA) used as an antidepressant. It does not have significant effects on the QT interval and therefore is unlikely to precipitate Torsades de pointes.<br/><br/><b>Rivastigmine</b> is a cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease dementia. It does not affect the cardiac conduction system and hence doesn't predispose to Torsades de pointes.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>Lithium</b>, commonly used in bipolar disorder, primarily affects the central nervous system rather than the cardiac conduction system. While it may cause several side effects such as tremor or thyroid dysfunction, it does not typically lead to QT interval prolongation or Torsades de pointes.<br/><br/></div>
