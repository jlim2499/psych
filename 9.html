<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>In an effort to try and estimate the average height of patients with schizophrenia, a medical student conducts a small study within a psychiatric hospital. The hospital has a total of 245 patients. The student creates a list of all the patients and assigns them all a unique identification number. Patients are then selected at random to produce a sample of 20. The height of each patient is then recorded and the mean score calculated.<br/>How is the sampling strategy of the study best described?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Simple random sampling </span></div><br/><br/>Explanation for the Correct Answer:<br/><br/>Simple random sampling: The study described involves assigning each patient a unique identification number and then selecting patients at random to produce a sample. This process indicates that each patient has an equal chance of being selected, which is the defining characteristic of simple random sampling. Hence, Option 3 is the correct answer.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Stratified sampling: This would involve dividing the population into subgroups based on certain characteristics, and then randomly sampling from each subgroup. The description does not indicate that any stratification was used.<br/><br/>Multilevel sampling: Multilevel sampling involves sampling within several hierarchical levels, such as regions, clusters within regions, and then subjects within clusters. This is not indicated in the study description.<br/><br/>Cluster sampling: In cluster sampling, the population is divided into clusters, and a random sample of clusters is chosen, with all members of selected clusters being included. This method was not described.<br/><br/>Systematic sampling: This method involves selecting every nth individual from a list. The description does not specify that every nth patient was selected, but rather that patients were chosen at random, which does not suggest a systematic approach.<br/></div>
