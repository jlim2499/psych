<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is an inferential statistic?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Standard error</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Standard error</b>. The standard error (SE) is an inferential statistic because it quantifies the precision of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean. It helps in making inferences about the population from which the sample is drawn.<br/><br/><b>Mode</b>. This statement is incorrect. Mode is a descriptive statistic that indicates the most frequently occurring value in a data set. It describes a characteristic of the sample or population data without making inferences about the population.<br/><br/><b>Range</b>. This statement is incorrect. Range is also a descriptive statistic that measures the difference between the highest and lowest values in a data set. It provides information about the spread of the data but does not help in making inferences about the population.<br/><br/><b>Standard deviation</b>. This statement is incorrect. Standard deviation (SD) is a descriptive statistic that measures the variability or dispersion of data points around the mean. While it describes the spread of the data, it does not make inferences about the population.<br/><br/><b>Mean</b>. This statement is incorrect. Mean is a descriptive statistic that represents the average of a set of values. It summarises the central tendency of the data but does not involve making inferences about the population from which the sample is drawn.<br/></div>
