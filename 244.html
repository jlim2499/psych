People with subsequent acute coronary syndrome requiring hospitalization after their first psychiatric admission were matched with 20 controls for age, sex and the year of first psychiatric admission using risk-set sampling. The effects of antipsychotic agents on the development of acute coronary syndrome were assessed using multiple conditional logistic regression and sensitivity analyses to confirm any association.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Nested case-control study</b> The nested case-control study is essentially a case-control study that draws cases and controls from an existing cohort</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>299.</b></td><td>Pandemic A (H1N1) 2009 mortality rates varied widely from one country to another. Our aim was to identify potential socioeconomic determinants of pandemic mortality and explain between-country variation.<br/><br/>Based on data from a total of 30 European countries, we applied random-effects Poisson regression models to study the relationship between pandemic mortality rates (May 2009 to May 2010) and a set of representative environmental, health care-associated, economic and demographic country-level parameters. The study was completed by June 2010.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Ecological study</b> Note the comparison of populations rather than individuals.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>300.</b></td><td>Erectile dysfunction is a common problem, affecting more than half of all men between the ages of 40 and 70 years. The authors goal was to quantify the prevalence of concomitant erectile dysfunction and active depression among patients seen in a general medical setting between September 1998 and September 1999. Simple random sampling techniques were used to select a subset of 334 patients from 73 general medical practices affiliated with an academic tertiary referral center in Pennsylvania. Of the 334 patients sampled, the authors received responses from 268 subjects (80.2%) and completed questionnaires from 199 subjects (59.6%) with a mean age of 59 years. The survey instrument consisted of three major sections: demographic and health history information, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale, and the five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function Scale. The prevalence of moderate or complete erectile dysfunction in this sample was 36.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 29.6, 43.1). The prevalence of current depression by CES-D Scale criteria was 12.1% (95% CI: 7.5, 16.7), and the prevalence of concomitant erectile dysfunction and depression was 5.1% (95% CI: 2.0, 8.1). Using logistic regression, the authors found that current depressive symptoms were not associated with moderate or complete erectile dysfunction (odds ratio = 1.3, 95% CI: 0.5,3.1; p= 0.565). Concomitant erectile dysfunction and depress ion represent a significant public health problem.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Analytical cross-sectional study</b> This is a cross-sectional study (it looks at a specific point in time). The study is attempting to find a correlation and so is analytical rather than descriptive.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/></div>
