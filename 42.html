In Susser’s framework, time order is a fundamental criterion for causation. The cause must precede the effect in time. Without establishing a temporal relationship, causality cannot be inferred.<br/><br/><b>Strength</b>: Strength is a criterion in Bradford Hill’s framework and refers to the magnitude of an association. It is not a foundational element of Susser’s framework.<br/><br/><b>Consistency</b>: Consistency, part of Bradford Hill’s criteria, assesses whether an association is observed across different studies and populations. It is not a core requirement in Susser’s criteria.<br/><br/><b>Specificity</b>: Specificity, also part of Bradford Hill’s criteria, evaluates whether a cause leads to a specific effect. Susser’s framework does not prioritise specificity as a criterion for causation.<br/><br/><b>Coherence</b>: Coherence, a Bradford Hill criterion, ensures that the observed association aligns with existing biological or epidemiological knowledge. It is not a component of Susser’s criteria.<br/><br/></div>
