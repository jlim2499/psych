<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following types of regression is used with dichotomous variables?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Logistic</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Logistic</b> regression. Logistic regression is a statistical method for analysing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes). In other words, it predicts the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logistic function. Hence, it is also known as logistic regression. Since its outcome is binary, it can be used to model the likelihood of a disease or health condition occurring.<br/><br/><b>Log</b> regression does not exist in statistical analysis and hence is incorrect. It seems to be a confusion with logarithmic transformations that are sometimes applied in linear regression when dealing with skewed data.<br/><br/><b>Linear</b> regression, on the other hand, is used when we want to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable we want to predict is called the dependent variable (or sometimes, the outcome variable). The variable we are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable (or sometimes, the predictor variable). However, linear regression assumes that there's always an underlying relationship between these variables which might not be applicable for all cases especially for dichotomous variables where outcomes are binary.<br/><br/><b>Logical</b> regression does not exist within statistical methods in medical research and so this option can be disregarded.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>Lox's</b> regression isn't recognised as any form of statistical analysis method within medicine or any other field and appears to be included as a distractor choice here.<br/><br/></div>
