<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A researcher conducts a study looking into the age of diagnosis of adult ADHD. The results are normally distributed with a mean of 40 and a standard deviation of 5. In this distribution, 68% of the distribution would be found between what two numbers?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">35 and 45</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>35 and 45</b>. In a normal distribution, 68% of the data lies within one standard deviation (σ) of the mean (μ). Given a mean of 40 and a standard deviation of 5, the range can be calculated as follows:<br/><br/>Lower bound = μ - σ = 40 - 5 = 35<br/>Upper bound = μ + σ = 40 + 5 = 45<br/><br/>Therefore, 68% of the distribution would be found between 35 and 45.<br/></div>
