<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A study is conducted to explore the association between plasma phosphate and decline in renal function. The study began in 2014. The patients in the study were those referred to a nephrology clinic between 2006 and 2007. Laboratory measurements at baseline were noted from the patient files. Subsequently, the medical course of these patients, especially the decline in renal function, was followed through the medical charts until Jan 2013. From these data it could be calculated that renal function declined faster with higher phosphate levels at baseline.<br/>How is this study best described?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Retrospective cohort study</span></div><br/>The study is observational and not experimental as the researchers simply observe and do not manipulate any risk factors or interventions.<br/><br/>The study looks back in time and so is retrospective.<br/><br/>The study begins with a group (cohort) and follows them up to explore the effect of exposure. In this case the exposure is the serum level of phosphate in the blood.<br/><br/></div>
