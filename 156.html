It essentially means that the study is well-designed and well-conducted, and the results can be confidently attributed to the effects of the independent variable, not potential confounding variables. High internal validity is crucial for making confident claims about cause and effect because it implies that the study was able to demonstrate a true relationship between the independent and dependent variables.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Good construct validity: Construct validity relates to how well a test or tool measures the concept it's intended to measure. While important, it doesn't directly address the causality between variables.<br/><br/>Good criterion validity: Criterion validity assesses how well one measure predicts an outcome based on another measure. This type of validity is more about predictive relationships rather than causation.<br/><br/>Good face validity: Face validity pertains to whether a test appears to measure what it's supposed to measure, on the surface. It's the most superficial form of validity and doesn't necessarily indicate that the study can make causal claims.<br/><br/>Good external validity: External validity is about the extent to which the results of a study can be generalized to other situations and to other people. While external validity is important for the broader application of research findings, it doesn't ensure that a study can make accurate cause-and-effect conclusions.<br/></div>
