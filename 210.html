<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>In a randomised control trial assessing the efficacy of fluvoxamine in children with anxiety disorders, what type of data was used to measure outcomes on the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement scale?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Ordinal</span></div><br/>Explanation for the Correct Answer:<br/><br/>Ordinal is the correct option. The Clinical Global Impressions Improvement scale measures improvement in a patient's clinical status and ranks it on a scale, typically from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). This scale is inherently ordinal because each number represents a category that has a logical order in terms of severity or improvement but does not quantify the exact amount of improvement between each category.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Interval data would have equal distances between points on the scale, which is not the case with the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement scale as it does not measure the 'interval' between different levels of clinical status.<br/><br/>Dichotomous data represent variables that have only two categories or states (e.g., yes/no, true/false). The Clinical Global Impressions Improvement scale has more than two possible categories.<br/><br/>Numerical data imply that the data can be meaningfully added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided (i.e., quantitative data), but the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement scale is not quantitative.<br/><br/>Continuous data are measured on a continuum or a scale that has an infinite number of possible values within a selected range, which does not apply to the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement scale as it is a discrete scale with a finite number of categories.<br/><br/><br/></div>
