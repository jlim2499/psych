<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>The following figure is taken from a study that assessed the validity of the 12-Item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in screening for the most common postnatal psychiatric morbidities (mood, anxiety and adjustment disorders). <br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><a class="fancybox" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb031b.png" rel="group"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb031.png"/></a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"><a class="fancybox lbmagglasslink" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb031b.png" rel="group"><img src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/>For the results on the EPDS score, which group had the largest interquartile range? <br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Other disorder</span></div><br/>Explanation for the Correct Answer:<br/><br/>Other disorder is the correct option. From the box plot corresponding to the EPDS scores, 'Other disorder' shows the largest box, which indicates the largest interquartile range. This means that there was more variability in the EPDS scores among patients diagnosed with disorders categorized as 'Other'.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>No diagnosis would be incorrect because the box plot shows a smaller IQR compared to 'Other disorder'.<br/><br/>Adjustment disorder would be incorrect as its IQR is smaller than that of 'Other disorder'.<br/><br/>Depression disorder would be incorrect as well because the IQR shown is less than that of 'Other disorder'.<br/><br/>Anxiety disorder is also incorrect, as its IQR is visibly smaller than 'Other disorder's IQR on the box plot.<br/></div>
