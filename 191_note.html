It is the main method for illustrating the results of a meta-analysis.<br/><br/>Here is an example:<br/><br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><a class="fancybox" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb021b.png" rel="group"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb021.png"/></a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"><a class="fancybox lbmagglasslink" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb021b.png" rel="group"><img src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/>A forest plot takes all the relevant studies which ask the same question, identifies a common statistic in and displays them on a single image. Doing this allows direct comparison.<br/><br/><b>The axes</b><br/><br/>Forest plots have a vertical axis and horizontal axis.<br/><br/>The horizontal axis usually represents the statistic the studies being profiled show. This could either be a relative statistic like an odds ratio (OR) or a relative risk (RR). Or might be an absolute one such as Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) or Standardised Mean Difference (SMD). <br/><br/>The vertical line is known as the 'line of null (or no) effect'. This line is placed at the value where there is no association between an exposure and outcome or no difference between two interventions (in the above example it is placed at 1). Remember that relative statistics like OR or RR have a null effect value of 1 whereas absolute statistics like Absolute Risk or ARR or SMD, have a null difference value of 0. <br/><br/><b>The study results</b><br/><br/>Separate study results are place on the plot. Each horizontal line put onto a forest plot represents a separate study being analysed. In the example above you can see there are 16 separate studies. Each study result has two components to it:<br/><br/><ul><li>A point estimate of the study result (represented by a black box). The size of the boxes represents the weight or the relative contribution of each study to the overall meta-analysis. This weight is typically determined by the precision of the study's estimate, which is often related to the sample size and the variance of the outcome.</li><li>A horizontal line representing the 95% confidence intervals of the study result, with each end of the line representing the boundaries of the confidence interval. Note which line cross the line of no effect (any study line which crosses the line of null effect does not illustrate a statistically significant result).</li></ul><br/>The diamond represents the point estimate and confidence intervals when you combine and average all the individual studies together. If you drew a vertical line through the vertical points of the diamond, that represents the point estimate of the averaged studies. The horizontal points of the diamond represent the 95% confidence interval of this combined point estimate. if the horizontal tips of the diamond cross the vertical line, the combined result is potentially not statistically significant (as you cannot be certain that the null value isn't the true value).<br/><br/><b>The weighting</b><br/><br/>The weight (in %) indicates the influence an individual study has had on the pooled result. In general, the bigger the sample size AND the narrower the confidence interval (CI), the higher the percentage weight, the larger the box, and more the influence the study has on the pooled result.<br/><br/><b>Heterogeneity</b><br/><br/>Heterogeneity refers to variability between studies and can affect the ability to combine the data of the individual studies. There are two types of heterogeneity: clinical heterogeneity and statistical heterogeneity. <br/><br/>Clinical heterogeneity refers to the variability caused by differences in clinical variables, such as the patient population, interventions, outcome measures or setting of the included studies. Clinicians determine clinical heterogeneity, which means that it will always be a rather subjective decision. Readers should also consider these differences and subjectively decide whether the clinical heterogeneity is small enough for meta-analysis to be appropriate. <br/><br/>Statistical heterogeneity is the variability in effect estimates between the studies and can be quantified by various statistics. Forest plots only present the statistical heterogeneity. The simplest statistic is the IÂ², which quantifies the heterogeneity from 0 to 100%. There is no clear point beyond which there is too much heterogeneity. Some use a rule of thumb stating that around 25% is low heterogeneity, around 50% medium and around 75% high heterogeneity.<br/><br/>Because forest plots provide a visual representation of study estimates, another approach is to simply view the variation between studies and judge the presence of heterogeneity ('eyeball' analysis). This subjective assessment of heterogeneity has high reproducibility (intra-class correlation = 0.87) and has a significant association with the presence of heterogeneity, as assessed by a statistical test, suggesting this is a reasonable approach (Verhagen, 2014).<br/><br/>Heterogenicity is indicated by 'eyeball analysis' by the following:<br/><br/><ul><li>If the CIs are widely spread out and the point estimates vary considerably, this suggests heterogeneity (i.e., the studies show varying results)</li><li>Large deviations of individual studies from the overall estimate may indicate heterogeneity</li><li>If larger studies (larger boxes) show different effects than smaller studies (smaller boxes), this may indicate heterogeneity</li></ul><br/><b>Limitations</b><br/><br/>There are 3 main things we need to assess when reading a meta-analysis:<br/><br/><ul><li>Heterogeneity</li><li>The pooled result</li><li>Publication bias</li></ul><br/>A forest plot does a great job in illustrating the first two of these (heterogeneity and the pooled result). However, it cannot display potential publication bias to readers. A funnel plot can do that instead.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/><i>Verhagen (2014) Forest plots.
