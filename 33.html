<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Qualitative methods are most useful for which of the following? <br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Investigating anomalous results</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Investigating anomalous results</b>. Qualitative methods are particularly useful for exploring unexpected or unusual findings that arise in research. When a quantitative study produces anomalous results that do not fit the expected patterns, qualitative methods like interviews or focus groups can help uncover underlying factors or contextual explanations that might not be captured through numerical data alone. For example, if a drug trial shows a surprising lack of efficacy in one subgroup, qualitative research could provide insights into patients' experiences, beliefs, or behaviours that might explain the discrepancy.<br/><br/><b>Quantifying patient adherence to treatment protocols</b>: Quantifying adherence involves measuring the extent to which patients follow prescribed treatments, typically using quantitative methods such as surveys, tracking devices, or pharmacy records. This task is best suited to quantitative approaches as it requires numerical data to calculate adherence rates.<br/><br/><b>Predicting future trends in disease spread</b>: Predicting disease trends relies on statistical models and quantitative data, often involving large datasets to forecast future outcomes. This is not suited to qualitative methods, which are more focused on in-depth exploration of subjective experiences rather than predictive modelling.<br/><br/><b>Determining statistical correlations between variables</b>: Statistical correlations require quantitative methods to measure the strength and direction of associations between variables. Qualitative research does not involve numerical data, so it is unsuitable for identifying or quantifying statistical relationships.<br/><br/><b>Establishing the prevalence of a condition</b>: Prevalence is a quantitative measure that indicates the proportion of a population affected by a condition at a specific time. This is calculated using quantitative data from surveys, medical records, or epidemiological studies, not qualitative research.<br/></div>
