<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A psychiatrist develops two equivalent forms of a test to assess cognitive function in patients with early dementia. She administers both forms to the same group and compares the results to check for consistency. Which type of reliability is being assessed?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Parallel-forms reliability</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Parallel-forms reliability</b>. Parallel-forms reliability assesses the consistency between two equivalent forms of a test, ensuring that both versions measure the same construct similarly. In this case, the psychiatrist is evaluating cognitive function in patients with early dementia using two equivalent forms of the test, and comparing the results to ensure consistency across both forms. This is particularly useful in cognitive testing where practice effects may influence results if the same test is repeatedly administered.<br/><br/><b>Test-retest reliability</b>: Test-retest reliability assesses the stability of a test over time by administering the same test to the same individual on two different occasions. This is not applicable here, as the focus is on comparing two equivalent forms rather than the same form over time.<br/><br/><b>Inter-rater reliability</b>: Inter-rater reliability measures the consistency of scores between different raters or observers. It is relevant when multiple clinicians are involved in assessments but does not apply here, as this scenario involves consistency across test forms, not raters.<br/><br/><b>Internal consistency reliability</b>: Internal consistency reliability measures how consistently items within a single test assess the same construct, often using statistical measures like Cronbach's alpha. This type of reliability does not apply here, as it is not concerned with comparing two different forms of a test.<br/><br/><b>Split-half reliability</b>: Split-half reliability evaluates the internal consistency of a test by splitting it into two halves (e.g., odd and even items) and comparing the results. It does not apply here, as the scenario involves two equivalent forms rather than dividing a single form.<br/></div>
