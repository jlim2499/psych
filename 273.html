<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Regarding the correlation coefficient, which of the following is true?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">It can assume any value between -1 and 1</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>It can assume any value between -1 and 1</b>. The correlation coefficient, often denoted as Pearson's r, measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation), with 0 indicating no correlation.<br/><br/><b>It is a measure of similarity between two means</b> is incorrect because the correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables, not the similarity between their means.<br/><br/><b>It is represented by a small c</b> is incorrect because the correlation coefficient is typically represented by the letter r, not c.<br/><br/><b>It is stated in the same units as the dependent variable</b> is incorrect because the correlation coefficient is a unitless measure. It is a standardized value that describes the relationship between variables regardless of their units.<br/><br/><b>It is used to demonstrate causation</b> is incorrect because the correlation coefficient only indicates the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables. It does not imply causation; other statistical methods are required to establish a causal relationship.<br/></div>
