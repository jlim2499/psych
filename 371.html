<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following odds ratios indicates no difference in the odds between two groups?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">1</span></div><br/>Explanation for the Correct Answer:<br/><br/>The correct option is 1. An odds ratio of 1 indicates that the event is equally likely in both groups. In other words, there is no difference in the odds of the outcome occurring in one group compared to the other.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>0.5: An odds ratio less than 1 suggests that the event is less likely in the first group compared to the second.<br/><br/>Zero: An odds ratio of zero would suggest that the event never occurs in the first group; however, this is not a plausible real-world value because odds ratios compare the likelihood of events, and a value of zero would imply an impossibility of occurrence, which is not meaningful in this context.<br/><br/>2: An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates that the event is more likely in the first group compared to the second.<br/><br/>-1.5: Odds ratios are not negative numbers because odds cannot be negative. An odds ratio provides a measure of association between an exposure and an outcome, and a negative odds would not make sense in this context.<br/></div>
