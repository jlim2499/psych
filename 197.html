Following a wash out period (to enable elimination of any medication they might have been prescribed) patients with schizophrenia were randomly allocated to the new antipsychotic or to olanzapine. The patients were followed up over a 4 week period. At the end of the study period, each patient was assessed to see if they had experienced akathisia.<br/><br/>Considering the design of this study answer the following<br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>237.</b></td><td>What type of variable is the dependent variable?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Categorical </b> The correct answer is <b>categorical</b>. The dependent variable in this study is whether or not the patient experienced akathisia. This is a categorical variable because the outcome is binary (yes/no). Categorical variables are used to represent distinct groups or categories, and in this case, the categories are 'akathisia present' and 'akathisia absent'.<br/><br/><b>ordinal</b>: This would not be correct because an ordinal variable represents data with a meaningful order or ranking, such as severity levels (e.g., mild, moderate, severe). In this study, the outcome is binary without any ranking, making it categorical rather than ordinal.<br/><br/><b>ratio</b>: This is incorrect because ratio variables represent continuous data with a true zero point, such as age, weight, or height. The experience of akathisia does not fit this definition, as it does not involve continuous numerical measurement.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>238.</b></td><td>The researcher proposes that the number of patients that will develop akathisia will not differ between the new medication and olanzapine. Which type of hypothesis is stated here?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Null hypothesis</b> The correct answer is <b>null hypothesis</b>. The researcherâ€™s statement proposes that there is no difference in the number of patients developing akathisia between the new medication and olanzapine. A null hypothesis assumes no effect or no difference between groups and serves as the default assumption in statistical testing until evidence suggests otherwise.<br/><br/><b>research hypothesis</b>: This is incorrect because a research hypothesis (or alternative hypothesis) suggests that there is an effect or difference between groups. For example, if the researcher hypothesised that more patients would develop akathisia with the new medication compared to olanzapine, it would represent a research hypothesis.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>239.</b></td><td>Which sample statistic would be most useful to address the null hypothesis?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Chi-squared test</b> The correct answer is <b>Chi-squared test statistic</b>. The null hypothesis states that there is no difference in the proportion of patients developing akathisia between the new medication and olanzapine. Since the dependent variable (presence or absence of akathisia) is categorical and the independent variable (medication type) involves two independent groups, the chi-squared test is the most appropriate test statistic for this scenario.<br/><br/>Five steps to address the null hypothesis:<br/><br/>1) Define the research question: Determine whether there is a significant difference in the proportion of patients who develop akathisia between the two groups (new medication vs olanzapine).<br/>2) Establish the groups: There are two independent groups: one receiving the new medication and the other receiving olanzapine.<br/>3) Identify the variables and their data types: Dependent variable: Presence or absence of akathisia (categorical, binary). Independent variable: Medication type (categorical, with two levels).<br/>4) Establish whether the data are parametric or non-parametric: The data are non-parametric because the dependent variable is categorical.<br/>5) Select the appropriate statistical test: Use a chi-squared test statistic to compare the proportions of akathisia between the two groups.<br/><br/>Explanation of other options:<br/><br/><b>t-test</b>: This is incorrect because a t-test compares means of continuous data between groups. In this study, the dependent variable is categorical (presence or absence of akathisia), so a t-test is not suitable.<br/><br/><b>odds ratio</b>: While the odds ratio could be calculated to interpret the strength of the association between the medication type and akathisia, it is not a sample statistic directly used to test the null hypothesis. It is typically reported as part of the results.<br/><br/><b>regression coefficient</b>: This is not appropriate because regression coefficients are used in models that predict a dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. This study does not involve a predictive model but rather a comparison between two groups.<br/><br/><b>ANOVA test statistic</b>: This is incorrect because ANOVA is used to compare means of continuous data across three or more groups. In this case, the dependent variable is categorical, and there are only two groups being compared.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/></div>
