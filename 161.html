The size of the square for each study illustrated on a forest plot is proportional to the weight of the study.<br/><br/>The correct answer is <b>Rosenheck</b>. In a meta-analysis, the weight of each study is determined by its sample size and the precision of its effect estimate. The larger the sample size and the more precise the effect estimate, the greater the weight that study will have in the meta-analysis. In this Forest plot, you can infer which study contributed most by looking at the size of the squares representing each study. The square for Rosenheck is visibly larger than those for other studies, indicating it has a larger sample size and/or a more precise effect estimate, thus contributing most to the meta-analysis.<br/><br/><b>Essock</b> did not contribute most to the meta-analysis as indicated by its smaller square on the Forest plot. This suggests that it had either a smaller sample size or less precise effect estimates compared to Rosenheck.<br/><br/>Similarly, <b>Kane 88</b> also did not contribute most to this meta-analysis due to its smaller square on the Forest plot. The same logic applies here: either a smaller sample size or less precise effect estimates compared to Rosenheck.<br/><br/><b>Klieser</b>, like Essock and Kane 88, also did not contribute most to this meta-analysis. Its contribution was less significant as represented by its relatively small square on this Forest plot.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>Kumra</b>'s contribution was also less significant in comparison with Rosenheck's as suggested by its smaller square on this Forest plot. Again, it indicates that Kumra had either a smaller sample size or less precise effect estimates compared to Rosenheck.<br/><br/></div>
