<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following regarding research variables is true?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Changes in a dependent variable may result from changes in the independent variable</span></div><br/>The correct answer is '<b>Changes in a dependent variable may result from changes in the independent variable</b>'. This statement correctly defines the relationship between independent and dependent variables in research. The independent variable is what the researcher manipulates or changes to see if it has an effect on the outcome, which is measured by the dependent variable. Therefore, any changes observed in the dependent variable could potentially be attributed to alterations made to the independent variable.<br/><br/>Now let's discuss why other options are incorrect.<br/><br/>'<b>Dependent variables are affected by all other variables in a study</b>' is not entirely accurate. While it's true that dependent variables can be influenced by various factors within a study, they're primarily expected to respond to changes in the independent variable. Other variables (such as controlled or extraneous variables) should ideally be managed so they do not significantly impact the dependent variable.<br/><br/>'<b>Independent variables are not under of the experimenter's control</b>' is incorrect because, by definition, an independent variable is something that researchers intentionally manipulate to observe its influence on the dependent variable. This means it's directly under their control.<br/><br/>The option '<b>Controlled variables vary in response to changes in the independent variable</b>' is also false. Controlled variables are those that researchers keep constant throughout a study so they don't affect outcomes. They should not change in response to alterations of either dependent or independent variables.<br/><br/>Finally, '<b>Dependent variables are under the direct control of the experimenter</b>' isn't correct either. Although experimenters measure and record changes in dependent variables, these aren't directly manipulated or controlled by them - instead, their values depend on how subjects react to different conditions set using independent variables.<br/><br/></div>
