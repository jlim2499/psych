<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A study of 30 patients with depression compares the effectiveness of new antidepressant medication with standard treatment. 80% of the new treatment group achieved remission at 6 weeks, compared with only 40% of the standard treatment group. <br/>What is the number needed to treat for the new treatment?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">3</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">NNT = 1 / ARR</div>Explanation for the Correct Answer:<br/><br/>The Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) is the difference in the success rates between the new treatment and the standard treatment, which is 40% (0.40 as a decimal). To calculate the NNT, we take the inverse of the ARR, giving us 2.5, which we round up to the nearest whole number for practical application in a clinical setting.<br/><br/>NNT = 1 / ARR<br/><br/>ARR = CER - EER <br/><br/>CER = 0.4<br/>EER = 0.8<br/><br/>ARR = CER - EER<br/>= 0.4 -0.8<br/>= 0.4 <br/><br/>NNT = 1 / ARR<br/>= 1 / 0.4<br/>= 2.5<br/><br/>This value of 2.5 must be rounded up to 3 as the NNT must be a whole number (we don't count half a human).<br/></div>
