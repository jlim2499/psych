The focus is to evaluate the drugs safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects. <br/><br/><b>Phase II</b><br/><br/>In Phase II clinical trials the drug or treatment is given to a larger group of people (100-300) to see if it is effective and to further evaluate its safety.<br/><br/><b>Phase III</b><br/><br/>In phase III trials the drug or treatment is given to large groups of people (1,000-3,000) to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments (or placebos), and collect information that will allow the experimental drug or treatment to be used safely.<br/><br/><b>Phase IV</b><br/><br/>Phase IV trials (aka Post Marketing trials) are done after the drug has been granted a license.  They gather further information on the drug in areas not addressed in the previous trials (e.g. Safety in pregnancy) and also to find other potential uses for the drug.</div></div>
