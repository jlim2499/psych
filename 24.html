<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A study is performed looking at the chance of stroke in high-risk psychiatric patients taking a new oral antithrombotic drug compared to warfarin. The following results are obtained:<br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid1"><thead><tr><th></th><th>Number who had a stroke within a 3 year period</th><th>Number without stroke</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>New drug</td><td>10</td><td>190</td></tr><tr><td>Warfarin</td><td>12</td><td>588</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>What is the relative risk of having a stroke within a 3 year period for patients taking the new drug compared to warfarin?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">2.5</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">RR = EER / CER</div>The correct answer is <b>2.5</b>.<br/><br/>To calculate the relative risk (RR), we compare the risk of having a stroke within a 3-year period for patients taking the new drug versus those taking warfarin. The formula for RR is:<br/>RR = (Risk in the treatment group) / (Risk in the control group)<br/><br/>Here, the risk in the treatment group (new drug) is:<br/>Risk (new drug) = 10 / (10 + 190) = 10 / 200 = 0.05<br/><br/>The risk in the control group (warfarin) is:<br/>Risk (warfarin) = 12 / (12 + 588) = 12 / 600 = 0.02<br/><br/>Now, calculate RR:<br/>RR = 0.05 / 0.02 = 2.5<br/><br/>This means the risk of having a stroke is 2.5 times higher for patients taking the new drug compared to those taking warfarin.<br/></div>
