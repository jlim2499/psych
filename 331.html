Group A are given standard treatment. After 5 years 20 of the 100 patients have had a stroke. Group B have standard treatment plus a new drug designed to reduce the risk of a stroke. After 5 years 10 of the 60 patients have had an stroke. <br/>What are the odds of having a stroke whilst taking the new drug compared to the odds of having a stroke in those receiving treatment as usual?<br/><br/><br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">0.8</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Odds - remember a ratio of the number of people who incur a particular outcome to the number of people who do not incur the outcome<br/><br/>NOT a ratio of the number of people who incur a particular outcome to the total number of people</div>Odds of stroke in group B (new drug) = 10/50 = 1/5<br/><br/>Odds of stroke in group A (treatment as usual) = 20/80 = 1/4<br/><br/>Odds ratio of having a stroke = 1/5 divided by 1/4 = 0.8<br/><br/>An odds ratio of &lt; 1 implies that the risk of stroke is less in those exposed to the new drug compared to those receiving standard treatment. <br/><br/><br/></div>
