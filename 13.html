<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Regarding IQ testing, if a person scores 100, what percentage of people (on average) would be expected to score below this mark?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">50%</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>50%</b>. The IQ score is based on a standardised scale with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Therefore, an individual who scores exactly 100 is at the exact middle of the distribution, meaning that approximately half (50%) of the population would score below this mark.<br/></div>
