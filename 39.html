<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is true regarding PubMed searching?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Truncation is generally not a recommended search technique for PubMed </span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Truncation is generally not a recommended search technique for PubMed</b>. Truncation, which involves using a symbol (usually an asterisk ) to find all terms that begin with a given string of text, is not generally recommended in PubMed. This is because it can yield an excessive number of search results, many of which may be irrelevant. For example, searching 'neuro' could return results for neurology, neuroscience, neuroanatomy, and many others, which may not be specific to the research question.<br/><br/><b>The Boolean term OR is the default operator used in PubMed</b>: This is incorrect. The default Boolean operator in PubMed is actually <b>AND</b>, not <b>OR</b>. If no operator is specified between search terms, PubMed will automatically assume that you want both terms to be present, effectively using 'AND' between them.<br/><br/><b>PubMed processes Boolean connectors from right to left</b>: This is also incorrect. PubMed processes Boolean connectors from left to right by default, unless parentheses are used to change the order of operations.<br/><br/><b>The order of processing in PubMed cannot be changed by the use of parentheses</b>: This is incorrect. The order of processing in PubMed can indeed be changed by using parentheses. For example, if you want PubMed to process 'olanzapine OR quetiapine' before 'schizophrenia AND', you would use the following search query: 'schizophrenia AND (olanzapine OR quetiapine)'.<br/><br/><b>In PubMed, Boolean operators must be entered in lowercase letters</b>: This is incorrect. Boolean operators in PubMed, such as AND, OR, and NOT, must be entered in uppercase letters to be recognised by the search engine. If they are entered in lowercase, PubMed will treat them as regular words rather than operators.<br/></div>
