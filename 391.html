<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A college professor collects the results of a test from a group of students.  Each test then receives a grade from A to F (with A being the best and F the worst). Which of the following would be the most appropriate measure to describe the most common mark?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Mode</span></div><br/>The median would give the middle result, i.e. if there were 7 results as follows A, B, C, D, E, F, F then the median result would be a D. The question asks for the most common result however for which the mode would be used. In the above example the modal value would be an F. The mean would not be an appropriate measure in this case as the sum of (A + B + C + D + E + F + F) / 7 would be a meaningless result.<br/></div>
