This suggests that the true effect size could be substantially larger or smaller than the effect sizes shown within the scale of the graph. The purpose of the arrowhead is to indicate that the data should be interpreted with caution because the CI is not entirely visible and thus the precision of the estimate is low.<br/><br/>So, for the Mao 2012 study in the forest plot, the arrowhead indicates that:<br/><br/>The confidence interval is very wide and off the scale.<br/><br/>The other options can be explained as follows:<br/><br/>The study's contribution to the overall weighting is not indicated by an arrowhead; it is usually represented by the size of the square (the point estimate).<br/><br/>A heterogeneous sample would not be indicated by an arrowhead; instead, heterogeneity is often assessed with the IÂ² statistic or a Q-test.<br/><br/>Statistical significance is indicated by whether the CI crosses the line of no effect (usually the line of '1' in a forest plot of odds ratios or risk ratios, or '0' in a plot of mean differences). An arrowhead does not relate to statistical significance.<br/><br/>Patient outcomes, such as a death during a study, are not represented by an arrowhead in a forest plot.<br/></div>
