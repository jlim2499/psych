To increase the power of a subsequent study, the researchers should:<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Increase the sample size</span></div><br/><i><b>Previous Exam Question</b></i><br/><br/>The correct answer is <b>Increase the sample size</b>. Increasing the sample size reduces the variability of parameter estimates, making it easier to detect a true effect and increasing the power of the study. A larger sample size decreases the likelihood of a Type II error (false negative), ensuring that a real difference is more likely to be identified if it exists.<br/><br/><b>Decrease the effect size</b>: Decreasing the effect size does not increase power. In fact, detecting smaller effect sizes requires greater power, which is often achieved by increasing the sample size. Effect size is a characteristic of the study and is not something researchers can manipulate after the fact.<br/><br/><b>Lower the significance level from 0.05 to 0.01</b>: Lowering the significance level reduces the likelihood of a Type I error (false positive) but also decreases power, as it makes the criteria for rejecting the null hypothesis stricter. This would make it harder, not easier, to detect a true effect.<br/><br/><b>Increase the variability of the sample</b>: Increasing variability decreases power, as it increases the noise in the data, making it harder to detect a true effect. Reducing variability through careful sample selection and measurement is generally more beneficial for increasing power.<br/><br/><b>Use a less sensitive outcome measure</b>: Using a less sensitive outcome measure reduces the ability to detect differences between groups, thereby lowering power. Researchers should aim to use more sensitive and precise measures to improve power.<br/></div>
