<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is true regarding literature searching using PubMed?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">The Medline database is a subset of PubMed </span></div><br/>The correct answer is: <b>The Medline database is a subset of PubMed</b>. PubMed, a free search engine maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM), includes more than 30 million citations for biomedical literature. This extensive database encompasses several subsets, one of which is MEDLINE. With over 25 million citations from life science journals and online books, MEDLINE forms a substantial part of the PubMed system but does not constitute its entirety. The Medline database is a subset of PubMed (i.e. PubMed is broader in scope) The majority of the publications covered in MEDLINE are scholarly journals but a small number of newspapers, magazines, and newsletters are also included.<br/><br/>Contrary to <b>All PubMed citations have been indexed by the NLM</b>, not all articles in PubMed are indexed by NLM or included in MEDLINE. Some citations might be from journals that are still under consideration for inclusion in MEDLINE or from journals that have been rejected for inclusion.<br/><br/>The statement <b>Medline citations are restricted to those from North America</b> is incorrect as well. Although it's true that the NLM, responsible for maintaining MEDLINE, is based in the United States, the database itself contains bibliographic information from scientific literature worldwide and isn't limited to North American sources.<br/><br/>Similarly, <b>Medline only contains citations in English</b> is also false. While many articles indexed in MEDLINE are indeed published in English due to the predominance of English as the lingua franca of scientific communication, there's no language restriction per se on articles indexed in this database.<br/><br/>Lastly, the claim that <b>Publications covered in Medline are exclusively from scholarly journals and do not include publications from newspapers and magazines</b> needs clarification. It's true that most content comes from peer-reviewed biomedical literature; however, some selected newspapers and magazines relevant to health care are also included. Therefore, while scholarly journals form a significant part of its content base, they don't represent an exclusive source.<br/><br/></div>
