<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A study is carried out to assess the potential for CBT to reduce serious self harm in people with borderline personality disorder. The average age of the patients was 32 years. Over a two-year period 800 patients were recruited and assigned randomly either to the CBT group or standard care group.<br/>The results:<br/><br/>CBT group: 400 patients - 10 of whom had an episode of serious self harm over the two year period<br/><br/>Control group: 400 patients - 20 of whom had an episode of serious self harm over the two year period<br/><br/>What is the absolute risk reduction?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">0.025</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">ARR = CER - EER</div>The correct answer is <b>0.025</b>. The absolute risk reduction (ARR) in a clinical trial is the difference in outcome rates between the control group and the treatment group. In this case, the rate of serious self harm in the control group (standard care) was 20 out of 400 patients (5%) while in the CBT group it was 10 out of 400 patients (2.5%). The ARR is therefore 5% - 2.5% = 2.5%, or when expressed as a proportion, <b>0.025</b>.<br/><br/>The option <b>0.05</b> might be chosen if one incorrectly calculated only the percentage of serious self harm in the control group and failed to subtract that of CBT group.<br/><br/>The option <b>2</b> would be incorrect because it may represent a misunderstanding about how to calculate ARR which should be expressed as a percentage or a proportion, not as an integer.<br/><br/>The option <b>10</b>, could be selected if one erroneously considered the actual number difference of people who had an episode of serious self-harm between two groups as ARR, without taking into account the total number of people in each group.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>0.5</b>, may have been chosen if one mistakenly divided the number difference by only one of two groups' size instead of calculating relative risk reduction or wrongly calculated ARR as relative risk reduction which requires division operation rather than subtraction.<br/><br/></div>
