Calculate the mean age of women in the study.<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">26</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>26</b>. The mean age is calculated by adding up all the ages and then dividing by the number of subjects. In this case, if you add 18, 22, 40, 17, 23, 18 and 44 together you get a total of 182. Then divide that by the number of subjects which is seven, and you get approximately 26.<br/><br/>Now let's look at the incorrect answers:<br/><br/><b>18</b>: This appears to be a common age amongst the subjects (with two participants being this age), however it doesn't take into account any of the other ages in the study. The mean requires all data points to be considered.<br/><br/><b>31</b>: This value seems to have been influenced heavily by the older ages in the study. While there are women in their forties participating in this study, there are also several significantly younger women whose ages need to be factored into calculating an accurate mean.<br/><br/><b>23</b>: This could potentially be mistaken as a median rather than a mean. The median is found by arranging values from lowest to highest and choosing the middle one. However, we are asked for the mean here not median.<br/><br/><b>22</b>: Similar to option '18', this might have been chosen due to its presence twice within our data set but it does not represent an average of all given ages.<br/><br/>In conclusion, understanding how to calculate averages such as means is fundamental in interpreting qualitative studies and can provide useful information about your sample population.<br/></div>
