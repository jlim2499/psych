Discrete data is numerical data that can take on specific, distinct values, often representing counts or whole numbers. For example, the number of patients admitted to a hospital in a day is discrete data because it cannot take fractional values.<br/><br/><b>Always qualitative</b>: This is incorrect. Discrete data is numerical, not qualitative. It involves quantifiable values, unlike qualitative data, which represents non-numerical characteristics.<br/><br/><b>Numerical and can take on any value within a range</b>: This is incorrect. This describes continuous data, which can take any value within a range, such as weight or height. Discrete data is limited to specific, separate values.<br/><br/><b>Non-numerical and continuous</b>: This is incorrect. Discrete data is numerical, and continuous data refers to measurements that can take any value within a range, not discrete categories.<br/><br/><b>Synonymous with continuous data</b>: This is incorrect. Discrete data is distinct from continuous data. Discrete data involves separate values (e.g., counts), while continuous data can have any value within a range (e.g., time, weight).<br/></div>
