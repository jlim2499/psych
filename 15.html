The admitting doctor notices that she has dry, cracked scaly skin, and further enquiry reveals recent onset of diarrhoea and irritability.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b><i>Previous Exam Question</i></b><br/><br/>The correct answer is <b>Vitamin B3</b>. Pellagra, caused by a deficiency in vitamin B3 (niacin), is characterised by the '3 Ds': dermatitis, diarrhoea, and dementia. The patient presents with dry, cracked, scaly skin, which aligns with pellagra’s dermatological manifestations, alongside diarrhoea and irritability, common symptoms of this deficiency. Chronic alcohol use often results in niacin deficiency, further supporting this diagnosis. Pellagra is frequently seen in individuals with poor diets, such as those struggling with alcoholism, and can lead to significant neuropsychiatric symptoms, including irritability and confusion.<br/><br/><b>Vitamin B6</b>: Although vitamin B6 deficiency can lead to irritability, confusion, and neurological symptoms, this patient’s primary skin symptoms and diarrhoea are more typical of pellagra (vitamin B3 deficiency) rather than vitamin B6 deficiency. Symptoms of vitamin B6 deficiency also include seborrhoeic dermatitis and angular cheilitis, which are not described in this case.<br/><br/><b>Vitamin A</b>: While vitamin A deficiency is associated with night blindness and skin issues such as dry, rough skin, it does not typically present with diarrhoea or neuropsychiatric symptoms like irritability, which are seen in this case. The gastrointestinal and psychiatric symptoms point more strongly towards a niacin deficiency.<br/><br/><b>Vitamin D</b>: Deficiency in vitamin D can result in bone-related disorders such as rickets and osteomalacia but is not associated with diarrhoea, scaly skin, or irritability. Vitamin D deficiency is more commonly linked with bone pain and muscle weakness rather than the constellation of symptoms described here.<br/><br/><b>Vitamin B12</b>: While vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to irritability, fatigue, and neurological degeneration, it is more typically associated with anaemia and neuropsychiatric symptoms such as memory problems or depression. The presence of diarrhoea and skin changes makes vitamin B12 deficiency unlikely in this scenario.<br/><br/><b>Vitamin K</b>: Vitamin K deficiency is primarily associated with coagulation disorders, leading to easy bruising, bleeding, or haemorrhage. It does not cause the combination of diarrhoea, scaly skin, or irritability seen in this patient, making it an unlikely cause of the symptoms.<br/><br/><b>Vitamin E</b>: Deficiency in vitamin E is linked to neurological symptoms such as ataxia and peripheral neuropathy, rather than skin changes and gastrointestinal symptoms. The absence of neurological signs and the presence of diarrhoea and skin changes in this patient makes vitamin E deficiency an unlikely diagnosis.<br/><br/><b>Vitamin B1</b>: While vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency can lead to neurological syndromes such as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, it is associated with peripheral neuropathy and heart failure in severe cases (beriberi), not the skin changes and diarrhoea described in this scenario. The gastrointestinal symptoms and dermatitis point more strongly towards pellagra (niacin deficiency).<br/><br/>This case highlights the importance of recognising classic presentations of vitamin deficiencies, particularly in patients with alcohol dependence, as this population is at increased risk for deficiencies in multiple vitamins, especially niacin, thiamine, and pyridoxine.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>16.</b></td><td>A 42-year-old man with depression and alcohol dependence is admitted to the inpatient ward in view of suicidal thoughts.  Over the course of a 6-week admission, he develops widespread oedema starting at his fingers and becomes breathless.  A chest X-ray reveals bilateral pleural effusions.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b><i>Previous Exam Question</i></b><br/><br/>he correct answer is <b>Vitamin B1</b>. This patient is likely suffering from wet beriberi, a condition caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, which is commonly seen in individuals with alcohol dependence. Wet beriberi presents with cardiovascular symptoms, including widespread oedema, breathlessness, and pleural effusions. Alcohol dependence interferes with thiamine absorption, leading to thiamine deficiency, which can cause both wet and dry beriberi. Wet beriberi affects the cardiovascular system, leading to heart failure, while dry beriberi affects the peripheral nervous system.<br/><br/><b>Vitamin B6</b>: While vitamin B6 deficiency can cause neurological and dermatological symptoms such as confusion, irritability, and seborrhoeic dermatitis, it does not typically result in widespread oedema, pleural effusions, or cardiovascular symptoms. The patient’s presentation is more consistent with thiamine deficiency than pyridoxine deficiency.<br/><br/><b>Vitamin A</b>: Vitamin A deficiency can lead to night blindness and dry skin, but it does not cause oedema or pleural effusions. The symptoms described here are more cardiovascular in nature and are more indicative of wet beriberi rather than vitamin A deficiency.<br/><br/><b>Vitamin D</b>: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with bone disorders such as rickets and osteomalacia, rather than cardiovascular symptoms like oedema and pleural effusions. This patient’s presentation of fluid overload and pleural effusions is not consistent with vitamin D deficiency.<br/><br/><b>Vitamin B12</b>: Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause neurological issues and anaemia, but it is not typically associated with cardiovascular symptoms like oedema or pleural effusions. The patient’s history of alcohol dependence and the development of these specific symptoms suggest thiamine deficiency rather than cobalamin deficiency.<br/><br/><b>Vitamin K</b>: Vitamin K deficiency primarily affects blood clotting, leading to an increased risk of bleeding and bruising. However, it does not cause widespread oedema or pleural effusions. The clinical picture of cardiovascular involvement and fluid retention makes vitamin K deficiency an unlikely diagnosis in this scenario.<br/><br/><b>Vitamin B3</b>: Pellagra, caused by vitamin B3 (niacin) deficiency, typically presents with the '3 Ds': dermatitis, diarrhoea, and dementia. It does not cause the cardiovascular symptoms such as oedema or pleural effusions described in this patient. Therefore, niacin deficiency is not a likely explanation.<br/><br/><b>Vitamin E</b>: Vitamin E deficiency can lead to neurological issues such as ataxia and peripheral neuropathy, but it is not associated with cardiovascular problems like oedema or pleural effusions. The patient’s alcohol dependence and the cardiovascular symptoms point more towards thiamine deficiency (vitamin B1).<br/><br/>This case underscores the importance of recognising thiamine deficiency (wet beriberi) in patients with alcohol dependence who present with cardiovascular symptoms such as oedema and pleural effusions. Wet beriberi can lead to severe heart failure if untreated, making early diagnosis and treatment critical.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>17.</b></td><td>An elderly patient with schizophrenia on the ward is being jointly managed by mental health and the respiratory team who are treating him for tuberculosis.  He is taking isoniazid and quetiapine.  Whilst on the ward he develops a widespread rash, a red swollen tongue, and painful cracked lesions at the corners of his mouth.  He is also noted to be increasingly confused.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b><i>Previous Exam Question</i></b><br/><br/>The correct answer is <b>Vitamin B6</b>. Isoniazid, a drug used in the treatment of tuberculosis, inhibits the action of pyridoxine (vitamin B6), leading to deficiency. Vitamin B6 deficiency is known to cause symptoms such as a red, swollen tongue (atrophic glossitis), angular cheilitis (cracked lesions at the corners of the mouth), seborrhoeic dermatitis, and confusion. Patients on isoniazid are commonly given prophylactic pyridoxine to prevent these side effects. The confusion may also be related to the neurological effects of vitamin B6 deficiency, which can include irritability, depression, and seizures in severe cases.<br/><br/><b>Vitamin B3</b>: Although vitamin B3 deficiency (pellagra) can cause dermatitis, diarrhoea, and dementia (the '3 Ds'), it does not typically cause a red swollen tongue or angular cheilitis. The patient's history of isoniazid use points more towards a vitamin B6 deficiency than niacin deficiency.<br/><br/><b>Vitamin B12</b>: Vitamin B12 deficiency can present with confusion and neurological symptoms, but it is more commonly associated with anaemia and does not usually cause angular cheilitis or a swollen tongue. The patient’s presentation of skin and mucosal lesions, along with isoniazid treatment, is more indicative of vitamin B6 deficiency.<br/><br/><b>Vitamin C</b>: Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) presents with symptoms like gingival bleeding, poor wound healing, and petechiae. While it can cause generalised fatigue and irritability, the patient’s skin and mucosal symptoms are not characteristic of scurvy, and there is no mention of the bleeding or bruising typical of vitamin C deficiency.<br/><br/><b>Vitamin B1</b>: Vitamin B1 deficiency (thiamine) can cause Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, particularly in patients with alcohol dependence, but it does not cause a red swollen tongue or angular cheilitis. The confusion could be due to thiamine deficiency, but in this case, the dermatological and mucosal symptoms make vitamin B6 deficiency more likely.<br/><br/><b>Vitamin D</b>: Vitamin D deficiency primarily affects bone health, leading to rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults, and does not present with mucosal lesions, confusion, or a widespread rash. The patient's symptoms do not align with vitamin D deficiency.<br/><br/><b>Vitamin K</b>: Vitamin K deficiency is mainly associated with coagulation disorders, leading to easy bruising, bleeding, and haemorrhage. It does not typically cause the mucosal lesions or confusion described in this case, and there is no evidence of bleeding or clotting issues in this patient.<br/><br/><b>Vitamin E</b>: Vitamin E deficiency can lead to neurological issues such as ataxia and peripheral neuropathy, but it does not cause mucosal lesions or a widespread rash. The patient’s symptoms are more consistent with pyridoxine deficiency caused by isoniazid.<br/><br/>This case highlights the importance of vitamin B6 supplementation in patients on isoniazid therapy to prevent neurological and dermatological symptoms associated with pyridoxine deficiency.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/></div>
