<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is recommended when performing a literature review?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Include grey literature</span></div><br/>The correct answer is to <b>include grey literature</b>. Grey literature refers to non-traditional forms of scientific communication, such as reports, policy documents, conference papers, and other unpublished works. Including grey literature in a systematic review can help minimise publication bias and provide a more comprehensive view of the available evidence. This practice is recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.<br/><br/><b>Attempting to restrict searching to just one database</b> is not recommended when performing a literature review. Limiting the search to only one database may result in missing out on relevant studies that are indexed in other databases. Multiple databases should be searched to ensure a thorough and comprehensive literature review.<br/><br/>The option <b>do not include evidence from existing literature reviews on the same subject</b> is incorrect. Existing literature reviews can provide valuable insights into the topic and highlight key findings or gaps in the current knowledge base which can guide your own research question or methodology. However, it's important to critically appraise these reviews for their quality and relevance.<br/><br/>The statement <b>avoid the use of Boolean operators when conducting searches on databases</b> is also incorrect. Boolean operators such as AND, OR, NOT are fundamental tools used in database searches to combine or exclude keywords in a precise manner, allowing for a more focused and productive search.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>avoiding primary sources of evidence</b> is not advisable during a literature review. Primary sources are original studies that have not been interpreted by others and they provide direct evidence about the subject of interest. They are considered an essential component of any robust literature review due to their high level of evidence.<br/><br/></div>
