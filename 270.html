<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A contingency table is constructed for a new blood protein marker to screen for prostate cancer in men aged between 50 and 70 years:<br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid1"><thead><tr><th></th><th>Prostate cancer present</th><th>Prostate cancer absent</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>New test positive</td><td>19</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>New test negative</td><td>14</td><td>723</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>What is the positive predictive value of the new test?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">19/39</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>19/39</b>. The positive predictive value (PPV) of a test is the probability that subjects with a positive screening test truly have the disease. It is calculated as the number of true positives (those with the disease who test positive) divided by the total number of positive tests results, both true and false positives. In this case, there are 19 true positives (men with prostate cancer who tested positive) and 20 false positives (men without prostate cancer who tested positive), so PPV = 19/(19+20) = 19/39.<br/><br/>The first option, <b>19/20</b>, would be the sensitivity of the new test if all men with prostate cancer were to test positive. Sensitivity is defined as the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified as such. However, in this case, not all men with prostate cancer tested positive - some tested negative - hence this option is incorrect.<br/><br/>The second option, <b>723/743</b>, would represent the specificity of the new test if all men without prostate cancer were to test negative. Specificity refers to the ability of a test to correctly identify those without the disease. Here though, not all men without prostate cancer tested negative - some tested positive - making this option incorrect.<br/><br/>The fourth option, <b>19/33</b>, seems to miscalculate PPV by adding up false negatives (men with prostate cancer who tested negative) and true positives (men with prostate cancer who tested positive). This does not provide an accurate measure for PPV.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>723/737</b> incorrectly calculates PPV by dividing true negatives (men without prostate cancer who tested negative) by total negatives which includes both true negatives and false negatives.<br/><br/>Therefore, none of these options apart from 19/39 accurately calculate the Positive Predictive Value in this scenario.<br/></div>
