Confounding factors are associated with both the exposure and the disease.<br/><br/>Consider a study which finds that people who drink coffee are more likely to develop heart disease.  The confounding factor in this study is smoking.  Smoking is associated with both drinking coffee and heart disease.  People who drink coffee are also more likely to smoke.  In this case smoking confounds the apparent relationship between coffee and heart disease.  <br/><br/>Confounding occurs when there is a non random distribution of risk factors in the populations.  Age, sex and social class are common causes of confounding.<br/><br/>In the design stage (Jager, 2008) of an experiment, confounding can be controlled by:<br/><br/><ul><li>randomisation (which aims to produce an even amount of potential risk factors in two populations)<ul><li>Simple Randomisation: Each participant has an equal chance of being assigned to any of the study groups. This method is straightforward but may lead to unequal group sizes in smaller studies.</li><li>Block Randomisation: Participants are divided into blocks, and within each block, they are randomly assigned to different groups. This ensures that group sizes remain balanced throughout the study.</li><li>Stratified Randomisation: Participants are first stratified based on specific characteristics (e.g., age, gender, disease severity) that are potential confounders. Randomisation then occurs within each stratum, ensuring these confounding variables are evenly distributed across groups.</li><li>Cluster Randomisation: Entire groups or clusters (e.g., schools, hospitals) are randomised rather than individual participants. This is useful when interventions are applied at the group level.</li><li>Adaptive Randomisation: The probability of assignment to a particular group changes based on accumulated data during the trial. This method aims to assign more participants to the more effective treatment but requires complex statistical approaches.</li><li>Minimisation: An adaptive method that allocates participants to groups in a way that minimizes imbalance in confounding variables. It considers the characteristics of participants already assigned when determining the group for a new participant.</li></ul></li><li>restriction (For example, in a study looking at the association between physical activity and heart disease, suppose that age and gender are the only two confounders of concern. If so, confounding by these factors could be avoided by making sure that all subjects are males between the ages of 40-50. This will ensure that the age distributions are similar in the groups being compared, so that confounding will be minimised)</li><li>matching (This is active form of control. For example, to ensure that two study groups do not differ with respect to possible confounders such as age and gender for every active male between the ages of 40-50, we could find and enroll an inactive male between the ages of 40-50. In this way, the groups we are comparing can artificially be made similar with respect to these factors, so they cannot confound the relationship).</li></ul><br/>In the analysis stage (Pourhoseingholi, 2012) of an experiment, confounding can be controlled for by:<br/><br/><ul><li>stratification - a statistical technique that allows to control for confounding by creating two or more categories (strata) in which the confounding variable either does not vary or does not vary very much.</li><li>multivariate models (e.g. logistic regression, linear regression, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA))</li></ul><br/>References:<br/><br/><i>Jager (2008) Confounding: What it is and how to deal with it.
