The questionnaire is then given to 100 community patients.<br/>The data is collected and is found not to be skewed. Which of the following is true?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">The mode would be an appropriate measure of central tendency for this data set</span></div><br/>Likert scales are ordinal scales. A Likert scale offers respondents a number of options to each question. For example:<br/><br/>Question: <br/><br/>How often do you pray?<br/><br/>Answer:<br/><br/>Never<br/>Rarely<br/>Occasionally<br/>Frequently <br/>Daily<br/><br/>Likert scales produce ordinal data sets, for this the mode and median are preferred as summary measures. The mean does not yield a meaningful result and so although used by some, it must be used with caution as it requires a number of assumptions to be stated to assist with interpretation. In view of this it cannot be stated that it is the 'most appropriate' summary measure.<br/><br/>The standard deviation should not be used for ordinal data.<br/></div>
