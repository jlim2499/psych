<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A study looking at the use of fish oils for schizophrenia reports the following figures in its results section. <br/>Control event rate (for remission) = 0.06<br/>Absolute risk reduction = 0.02<br/>Experimental event rate (for remission) = 0.08<br/><br/>Based on the above results what is the number needed to treat for the treatment?<br/><br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">50</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">NNT = 1 / ARR</div>The correct answer is <b>50</b>. The number needed to treat (NNT) can be calculated using the formula NNT = 1 / Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR). In this case, the ARR is given as 0.02. Therefore, NNT = 1 / 0.02 = 50. This means that for every 50 patients treated with fish oils, one additional patient would achieve remission compared to the control group.<br/><br/>The option <b>22</b> is incorrect because it does not follow the calculation of NNT from ARR. It seems like a random number without any basis from the given figures.<br/><br/>The option <b>16.6</b> might have been calculated by dividing the control event rate (0.06) by the experimental event rate (0.08). However, this is not a valid method for calculating NNT and hence, this answer is incorrect.<br/><br/>The option <b>12.5</b> may have been derived by subtracting the experimental event rate from the control event rate and then taking its reciprocal (1/(0.06-0.08)). But this calculation doesn't provide the correct method for determining NNT either.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>3.5</b> also seems to be an arbitrary figure which does not align with any known calculations for NNT based on provided data.<br/><br/>In conclusion, when interpreting results of clinical trials and studies in medical practice, it's crucial to understand how key measures such as absolute risk reduction and numbers needed to treat are calculated and what they signify about treatment effectiveness.<br/><br/></div>
