<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>When considering screening for a high-prevalence psychiatric condition, such as depression in primary care settings, which of the following statements is consistent with Wilson and Jungner's criteria for screening?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">The screening tool should have high public acceptance and be feasible in primary care</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>The screening tool should have high public acceptance and be feasible in primary care</b>. According to Wilson and Jungner’s screening criteria, a screening tool must be acceptable to the population and practical to implement within healthcare settings. For depression, a feasible and widely accepted screening method like the PHQ-9 in primary care can help identify individuals in need of further assessment and treatment, addressing a high-prevalence condition with significant public health implications.<br/><br/><b>Only individuals with strong family history of depression should be screened</b>: This is incorrect, as Wilson and Jungner’s criteria do not recommend restricting screening to those with a specific family history. Screening for high-prevalence conditions like depression should be broad to capture all at-risk individuals, not only those with hereditary factors.<br/><br/><b>Screening should be limited to patients with current suicidal ideation</b>: This is incorrect, as screening is intended to identify individuals at earlier stages of the condition before crisis points, like suicidal ideation, are reached. Limiting screening to those with acute symptoms contradicts the principle of early intervention.<br/><br/><b>Depression screening should be a one-time event for each patient</b>: This is incorrect, as Wilson and Jungner’s criteria support screening as a continuous process, especially for conditions like depression where symptoms may fluctuate over time. Periodic screening in primary care can help identify changes in mental health status.<br/><br/><b>The cost of screening should not be considered in deciding whether to implement the tool</b>: This is incorrect. Wilson and Jungner’s criteria emphasise the importance of balancing the costs of screening against the benefits and available resources. Cost-effectiveness is a fundamental aspect of deciding on the implementation of any public health screening programme.<br/></div>
