<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is true regarding QALYs?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Quality of life scores can be negative</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Quality of life scores can be negative</b>. Quality of life scores used in calculating QALYs (Quality-Adjusted Life Years) can be negative, indicating that some health states are perceived as worse than death (which is defined as 0). This happens when the burden of disease or disability is considered unbearable or severely limiting to the individualâ€™s well-being.<br/><br/><b>They form part of a cost-benefit analysis</b>: QALYs are not typically used in cost-benefit analyses, where both costs and benefits are measured in monetary terms. Instead, QALYs are more commonly used in cost-utility analyses, which measure health outcomes in terms of both quality and quantity of life gained.<br/><br/><b>The quality of life score must assume a value between 0 and 2</b>: The quality of life score used in QALY calculations typically ranges between 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health). Scores above 1 are not valid within the QALY framework.<br/><br/><b>One QALY is equal to 10 years of life in perfect health</b>: One QALY is defined as one year of life lived in perfect health, not 10 years. The calculation combines both the quality and the quantity of life, but it is typically on a scale of 1 year at full health.<br/><br/><b>QALYs cannot be calculated unless the cost of the intervention is known</b>: This is incorrect. QALYs can be calculated independently of the cost of the intervention. They measure the health benefit of an intervention, and costs are incorporated later in economic evaluations such as cost-utility analyses, where both costs and QALYs are compared.<br/></div>
