<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A new test is developed to screen for sex addiction. Trials have shown it has a sensitivity for detecting clinically significant sex addiction of 80% but a specificity of 60%. What is the likelihood ratio for a positive test result?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">2</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Likelihood ratio for a positive test result = sensitivity / (1 - specificity)</div>The correct answer is <b>2</b>. The likelihood ratio for a positive test result (LR+) is calculated by dividing the sensitivity by 1-specificity. In this case, that would be 0.8/(1-0.6) = 2.<br/><br/><b>0.8</b> is incorrect because it seems to confuse the value of sensitivity (80% or 0.8) with the likelihood ratio. Remember, the likelihood ratio isn't simply the sensitivity or specificity of a test; it's a calculation that incorporates both values to help determine how much a positive or negative test result changes the odds that a patient has a certain condition.<br/><br/><b>4</b> is incorrect and may result from misunderstanding how to calculate LR+. It might be derived from incorrectly subtracting specificity from sensitivity (i.e., 0.8 - 0.6), but this isn't how LR+ is calculated.<br/><br/><b>0.2</b> is incorrect and could possibly be derived from calculating specificity divided by sensitivity, which again, isn't how LR+ is calculated.<br/><br/>Finally, saying that it <b>Cannot be calculated</b> is also incorrect because we have all necessary information: both sensitivity and specificity are provided in the question stem, which are all we need to calculate LR+.<br/></div>
