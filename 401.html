<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following would be classified as a direct cost in an economic evaluation study?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Costs of training staff to provide an intervention</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Costs of training staff to provide an intervention</b>. In economic evaluation studies, direct costs are those that are directly attributable to the provision of a service or intervention. This includes costs such as personnel salaries, equipment, supplies, and training. Therefore, the cost associated with training staff to provide an intervention would be classified as a direct cost.<br/><br/><b>Costs due to impaired productivity at work</b>, while certainly a significant financial burden, would not be classified as a direct cost in this context. This type of cost is considered an indirect cost because it does not directly relate to the provision of healthcare services but rather results from the impact of illness or treatment on productivity.<br/><br/>Similarly, <b>worry associated with the outcome of a screening test</b> is also not considered a direct cost. This falls into the category of intangible costs which refer to non-monetary outcomes that affect quality of life such as pain, suffering or anxiety.<br/><br/><b>Time spent caring for a patient by a relative</b> is another example of an indirect cost. While this certainly represents a significant contribution and potential financial burden for families and caregivers, it does not directly relate to the provision of healthcare services and therefore would not be classified as a direct cost in an economic evaluation study.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>reduced ability to enjoy leisure activity due to illness or disability</b>, like worry about screening results, falls into the category of intangible costs. These are non-monetary outcomes that affect quality of life but do not represent direct costs associated with healthcare service provision.<br/><br/></div>
