Bracketing is a process in qualitative research, especially in phenomenology, where researchers consciously set aside their biases, assumptions, and prior knowledge about the phenomenon being studied. This allows the researcher to approach the data with an open mind, ensuring that their interpretation is based on participants’ experiences rather than being influenced by preconceived ideas. For example, in a study exploring the lived experience of anxiety, a researcher might bracket their own beliefs about anxiety (such as assuming it always involves panic attacks) to fully understand the participants' unique experiences.<br/><br/><b>Evaluating outliers</b> is a concept more common in quantitative research, where statistical analysis is used to identify data points that deviate significantly from the rest. Bracketing is not typically used in this context.<br/><br/><b>Determining sample composition</b> refers to the selection of participants in a study, which occurs before data collection. Bracketing is not relevant to this phase of the research, as it is used during data collection and analysis to reduce bias.<br/><br/><b>Determining sample size</b> is a methodological concern that is also unrelated to bracketing. It refers to deciding how many participants will be included in the study, often based on achieving data saturation.<br/><br/><b>Structuring interview questions</b> involves planning the questions to be asked in a qualitative study. While the structure of questions is important, bracketing is applied after data collection begins, to ensure that the researcher’s interpretations are not biased by their own expectations or experiences.<br/></div>
