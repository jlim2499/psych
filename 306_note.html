Knowing the scale of measurement for a variable is an important aspect in choosing the right statistical analysis.<br/><br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><a class="fancybox" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb059b.png" rel="group"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb059.png"/></a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"><a class="fancybox lbmagglasslink" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb059b.png" rel="group"><img src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/>Data variables are categorised as follows:<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid1"><thead><tr><th>Data type</th><th>Examples</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ratio (continuous)</td><td>- enzyme activity<br/>- dose amount<br/>- reaction rate<br/>- concentration<br/>- pulse<br/>- weight<br/>- length<br/>- temperature in Kelvin (0.0 Kelvin really does mean 'no heat')<br/>- survival time.</td><td>Like interval scales except they have true zero points (true / meaningful zero points means that 0 relates to the absence of something)<br/><br/>Ratio scales are like interval scales except they have true zero points. A good example is the Kelvin scale of temperature. This scale has an absolute zero. Thus, a temperature of 300 Kelvin is twice as high as a temperature of 150 Kelvin. Other examples of ratio scales include weight, time, and length.</td></tr><tr><td>Interval</td><td>- temperature (Farenheit)<br/>- temperature (Celcius)<br/>- pH<br/>- credit score</td><td>A measurement where the difference between two values is meaningful, such that equal differences between values correspond to real differences between the quantities that the scale measures (for example temperature)<br/><br/>On interval measurement scales, one unit on the scale represents the same magnitude on the trait or characteristic being measured across the whole range of the scale. For example, if depression were measured on an interval scale, then a difference between a score of 10 and a score of 11 would represent the same difference in depression as would a difference between a score of 50 and a score of 51. Interval scales do not have a true zero point, however, and therefore it is not possible to make statements about how many times higher one score is than another. For a depression scale, it would not be valid to say that a person with a score of 30 was twice as depressed as a person with a score of 15. A good example of an interval scale is the Fahrenheit scale for temperature. Equal differences on this scale represent equal differences in temperature, but a temperature of 30 degrees is not twice as warm as one of 15 degrees.</td></tr><tr><td>Ordinal</td><td>- socio economic status ('low income','middle income','high income')<br/>- education level ('high school','BS','MS','PhD')<br/>- income level ('less than 50K', '50K-100K', 'over 100K')<br/>- satisfaction rating ('extremely dislike', 'dislike', 'neutral', 'like', 'extremely like')</td><td>Observed values can be put into set categories which themselves can be ordered (for example social class). With ordinal data one cannot state with certainty whether the intervals between each value are equal. For example, on a 10 point scale, the difference between a 9 and a 10 is not necessarily the same difference as the difference between a 6 and a 7</td></tr><tr><td>Nominal</td><td>- genotype<br/>- blood type<br/>- zip / post code<br/>- biological sex<br/>- race<br/>- eye color<br/>- political party</td><td>Observed values can be put into set categories which have no particular order or hierarchy. You can count but not order or measure nominal data (for example birthplace)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>The following table allows comparison across the range of data types:<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid2"><thead><tr><th></th><th>Nominal</th><th>Ordinal</th><th>Interval</th><th>Ratio</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Established sequence</td><td>-</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Mode</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Median</td><td>-</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Mean</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Meaningful difference between variables</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Variables can be added and subtracted</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Variables can be divided and multiplied</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Absolute zero</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>Yes</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/><i>Note: Psychologist, Stanley Smith Stevens developed the best-known classification with four levels, or scales, of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.</i><br/><br/>Data can be categorized as quantitative versus qualitative:<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid3"><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Quantitative</td><td>Quantitative variables take on numeric values and can be further classified into discrete and continuous types.  A discrete variable is one whose values vary by specific finite steps (e.g. Number of siblings).  A continuous variable on the other hand, can take any value.   Quantitative variables can also be subdivided into interval and ratio types.</td></tr><tr><td>Qualitative</td><td>Qualitative variables do not take on numerical values and are usually names.  Some qualitative variables have an inherent order in their categories (e.g. Social class) and are described as ordinal.  Qualitative variables are also called categorical or nominal variables (the values they take are categories or names).  When a qualitative variable has only two categories it is called a binary (dichotomous or attribute) variable.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div>
