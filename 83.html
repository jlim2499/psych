<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is an example of selection bias?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Berkson's bias</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Berkson's bias</b>. This type of bias occurs when the selection of participants for a study is influenced by their likelihood to seek healthcare. For example, hospitalised patients are more likely to have multiple health issues, and thus they are not representative of the general population. This can lead to an overestimation of the association between diseases.<br/><br/><b>Observer bias</b>, also known as information or measurement bias, is incorrect due to its definition being distinct from selection bias. Observer bias occurs when there are systematic differences in the way data is collected for different groups. This could be due to the observer's knowledge about participant's exposure status influencing how they measure outcome variables.<br/><br/>The <b>Hawthorne effect</b> refers to changes in behaviour that occur when individuals know they are being observed. While this can certainly impact research findings, it does not fit into the category of selection bias because it does not influence who is included in a study sample.<br/><br/><b>Verification bias</b>, also known as referral or test review bias, happens when subjects with positive results are more likely to have their test results confirmed than those with negative results. Although this may influence the accuracy of diagnostic tests and overall study results, it isn't an example of selection bias since it doesn't affect who gets selected into a study.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Detection Bias</b> arises from differential methods of detection amongst groups leading to an apparent difference in outcome rates between these groups. It is often seen in studies where one group receives more frequent screening or follow-up than another group thereby increasing chances of detecting the disease earlier or more frequently but doesn't pertain to selection into a study which defines selection bias.<br/><br/></div>
