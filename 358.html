<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A frustrated psychiatrist creates a new screening tool to aid in the diagnosis of schizophrenia. The tool consist of just five questions and can be done in 10 minutes. He does a study on the tool versus the gold standard method of diagnosis to see how good the screening tool performs. He sets a number of cut-offs for the tool to help decide how many positive question responses are needed prior to a diagnosis of schizophrenia being made. Following this he constructs a ROC curve to help him see how the cut-off levels compare. <br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mma019.png"/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/>Based on the ROC curve, which cut-off point provides the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Cut-off point 3</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>cut-off point 3</b>. Cut-off point 3 provides the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity. This point lies closest to the top-left corner of the ROC curve, indicating a good balance between detecting true positives (sensitivity) and avoiding false positives (1-specificity). In clinical practice, this balance is crucial for accurately diagnosing schizophrenia, minimising the chances of missing true cases while also reducing unnecessary worry or treatment for those without the condition.<br/><br/><b>Cut-off point 1</b> is not correct. This cut-off point is too low, leading to high sensitivity but very low specificity. In other words, it would identify almost everyone as potentially having schizophrenia, resulting in a high number of false positives. This would be clinically impractical as it would lead to overdiagnosis and unnecessary anxiety and treatment for many patients who do not actually have schizophrenia.<br/><br/><b>Cut-off point 2</b> is not correct. While this point has improved specificity compared to cut-off point 1, it still has relatively low specificity and does not provide as optimal a balance as cut-off point 3. It would still result in a significant number of false positives, although fewer than cut-off point 1, leading to unnecessary further investigations and potential treatments.<br/><br/><b>Cut-off point 4</b> is not correct. This cut-off point, while having higher specificity, still does not provide as good a balance between sensitivity and specificity as cut-off point 3. It would still identify many false positives, leading to unnecessary further diagnostic procedures and potential treatments.<br/><br/><b>Cut-off point 5</b> is not correct. This point, similar to cut-off points 1 and 2, provides a suboptimal balance between sensitivity and specificity. It would still result in a higher number of false positives compared to cut-off point 3, leading to unnecessary anxiety, follow-up tests, and potential treatments for patients who do not have schizophrenia.<br/><br/>By choosing the optimal cut-off point, psychiatrists can ensure that their screening tool is both effective and efficient, minimising false positives and negatives, thus improving overall patient care and resource utilisation in clinical settings.<br/><br/></div>
