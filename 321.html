<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>The Delphi method is used to evaluate which of the following?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Expert consensus</span></div><br/>Why 'Expert consensus' is correct:<br/><br/>The Delphi method is a structured communication technique, originally developed as a systematic, interactive forecasting method which relies on a panel of experts. The experts answer questionnaires in two or more rounds. After each round, a facilitator provides an anonymous summary of the experts' forecasts and reasons for their judgments. This process is intended to reduce the range of responses and arrive at a converged consensus by the expert panel.<br/><br/>Why the other options are incorrect:<br/><br/>'Financial consequences of new medications': While financial analyses are important in the healthcare field, the Delphi method is not specifically designed for financial evaluation. It is aimed at consensus-building through expert opinion.<br/><br/>'Sample size': The Delphi method does not specifically deal with determining sample sizes for research studies; it is a qualitative method focused on gathering and synthesising the insights of experts.<br/><br/>'Confounding': This refers to a situation in which a false relationship is suggested between two variables because a third, confounding variable is not accounted for. The Delphi method is not a statistical tool to control or assess for confounding variables.<br/><br/>'Patient satisfaction': While the Delphi method could theoretically be used to gauge expert opinion on factors affecting patient satisfaction, it is not primarily a tool for measuring patient satisfaction itself.<br/></div>
