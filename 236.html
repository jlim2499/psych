<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A diagnostic test has an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.75. This indicates that: <br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">The test has fair accuracy</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>The test has fair accuracy</b>. An area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.75 indicates that the test has a fair ability to distinguish between cases (e.g., disease present) and controls (e.g., disease absent). AUC values between 0.7 and 0.8 are typically considered to represent fair accuracy.<br/><br/><b>The test has excellent accuracy</b>: This is incorrect. Excellent accuracy corresponds to an AUC of 0.9 or higher, which reflects very strong discriminatory ability. A value of 0.75 falls short of this threshold.<br/><br/><b>The test performs no better than chance</b>: This is incorrect. An AUC of 0.5 indicates no better than random chance. A value of 0.75 is significantly better than chance, demonstrating the test's ability to distinguish cases from controls.<br/><br/><b>The test has poor accuracy</b>: This is incorrect. Poor accuracy is associated with an AUC below 0.7. A value of 0.75 reflects fair, not poor, performance.<br/><br/><b>The test is perfect in distinguishing cases from controls</b>: This is incorrect. A perfect test would have an AUC of 1.0, which indicates 100% sensitivity and specificity. An AUC of 0.75 reflects fair but not perfect accuracy.<br/></div>
