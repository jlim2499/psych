<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A test that appears on first impressions to test what it is meant to is said to have which of the following?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Good face validity</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">A test which appears to test what it is meant to has good face validity.</div>The correct answer is <b>Good face validity</b>. Face validity refers to the degree to which a test appears, on its face, to be measuring what it purports to measure. In other words, if a test seems at first glance to be testing what it's supposed to test, then it has good face validity. This type of validity is often used in the development of assessment tools and questionnaires where it's important that the questions appear relevant and related to the construct being measured.<br/><br/><b>Good internal validity</b>, on the other hand, refers to how well an experiment is done, especially whether it avoids confounding (more than one possible independent variable [cause] acting at the same time). In essence, internal validity is about ensuring that any observed effects within your study can genuinely be attributed to the variables you're interested in studying.<br/><br/><b>Good external validity</b> pertains to how applicable or generalisable the results of a study are to settings outside of the specific conditions of that study. External validity might not be as important when a test simply needs to look like it measures what it claims.<br/><br/><b>Good construct validity</b> relates specifically to how well a test measures the concept or construct that it was designed to measure. It involves demonstrating that a test taps into a theoretical construct (like intelligence or social anxiety) and does not overlap too much with other constructs.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>good content validity</b> means that each item on the test represents all facets or components of the construct being measured. For example, if you were developing an assessment tool for depression, you would want items addressing all aspects of depression - emotional symptoms (e.g., feelings of sadness), cognitive symptoms (e.g., negative thoughts about self), physical symptoms (e.g., fatigue), and behavioural symptoms (e.g., withdrawal from activities).<br/><br/>Overall, while all these types of validities are crucial in test development and evaluation, face validity specifically refers to how a test appears on first impressions.<br/></div>
