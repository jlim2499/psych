<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is calculated by taking the square root of the variance?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Standard deviation</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Standard deviation</b>. Standard deviation is a statistical measure that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. It is calculated by taking the square root of the variance, which itself measures how far each number in the set is from the mean (or average) and thus from every other number in the set. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.<br/><br/><b>Interquartile range</b>, on the other hand, is not calculated using variance but it's another measure of statistical dispersion. The interquartile range represents the difference between the upper quartile (75th percentile) and lower quartile (25th percentile), effectively covering the middle 50% of data points.<br/><br/>The <b>Mean</b> is simply an average value calculated by adding up all numbers in a data set and then dividing by how many numbers there are in total. It does not involve taking square roots or calculating variances.<br/><br/><b>The coefficient of variation</b> does involve variance but it isn't its square root. Instead, it's defined as the ratio of standard deviation to mean, often expressed as a percentage. This measure provides a relative understanding about data variability regardless of units or scale.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>Median</b> refers to the middle value when you arrange all values from smallest to largest. If there's an even number of observations, median will be average of two middle numbers. Like mean, computation for median doesn't involve any square roots or calculation related to variance.<br/><br/>In summary, only standard deviation amongst these options involves calculating square root of variance which makes it correct answer for this question.<br/></div>
