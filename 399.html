This method of economic evaluation explicitly incorporates the concept of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) into its framework. QALYs are a measure of the state of health of a person or group in which the benefits, in terms of length of life, are adjusted to reflect quality-of-life factors. Cost-utility analysis compares different interventions based on their costs and their effects on patients' health-related quality of life. The result is usually expressed as cost per QALY, which allows for direct comparison between different healthcare interventions.<br/><br/><b>Cost-minimisation analysis</b> is incorrect because it only considers costs and assumes that outcomes are equivalent between the options being compared. It is typically used when two or more interventions have already been shown to be equally effective, and therefore the decision-making comes down to which option incurs less cost.<br/><br/><b>Cost-benefit analysis</b>, another incorrect choice, differs from cost-utility analysis by putting a monetary value on health outcomes. The results are often presented as a benefit-cost ratio or net present value rather than cost per QALY. Hence, it does not directly make use of QALYs.<br/><br/>The fourth option, <b>Cost-effectiveness analysis</b>, also does not make use of QALYs. Instead, it measures outcomes in natural units related to the intervention's objectives such as life years gained or cases prevented. While this approach can be useful for comparing similar types of interventions, it may not provide meaningful comparisons across different types of health programs with diverse objectives.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Cost-consequences analysis</b>, another incorrect option, lists all costs and consequences without aggregating them into a single measure like cost per QALY. This provides a detailed overview but makes it difficult to compare different interventions if they have varied costs and consequences.<br/><br/></div>
