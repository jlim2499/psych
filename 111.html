Snowball sampling is a non-probability sampling technique that is used by researchers to identify potential subjects in studies where subjects are hard to locate. This method is most suitable for studies involving 'hidden populations', such as individuals involved in illegal activities or socially stigmatised groups, who might not be easily accessible through other sampling methods. Researchers begin by identifying one or few participants and then ask them to help identify others, creating a 'snowball' effect.<br/><br/><b>Purposive</b> sampling, also known as judgmental or selective sampling, involves the researcher choosing participants based on their judgement about which ones will be most representative or informative. While this can be useful for gaining in-depth insights from specific individuals or groups, it does not specifically target hidden populations and may introduce bias due to the subjective nature of participant selection.<br/><br/><b>Opportunistic</b> sampling refers to selecting participants based on their availability or ease of recruitment. This method allows researchers to take advantage of unforeseen opportunities during fieldwork, but it's not designed specifically for reaching hidden populations and may result in a sample that's not representative of the broader population.<br/><br/><b>Case study</b> sampling involves in-depth investigation of a single instance or event (a case) in its real-life context. It provides detailed information about individual cases but does not allow for generalisation to larger populations and is therefore not ideal for identifying hidden populations.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Stratified</b> sampling divides the population into separate groups (strata) based on certain characteristics before randomly selecting participants from each group. This ensures representation across different strata but isn't particularly suited for reaching hidden populations unless those populations form a distinct stratum that can be identified and accessed separately.<br/><br/></div>
