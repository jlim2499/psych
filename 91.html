<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which type of association is described as one variable directly affecting another without a confounder?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Direct</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Direct</b>. A direct association occurs when one variable directly affects another without the involvement of a confounding variable. This type of association is often causal in nature. For example, smoking directly causes lung cancer due to the carcinogens in cigarette smoke damaging lung cells.<br/><br/><b>Spurious</b>: A spurious association appears to exist but is false or misleading, often due to a confounding variable or random chance. For instance, the relationship between ice cream sales and drowning deaths is spurious, as both are influenced by hot weather, not a direct or indirect causal link.<br/><br/><b>Indirect</b>: An indirect association exists when two variables are genuinely related, but their relationship is mediated by a third variable. For example, socioeconomic status is associated with health outcomes through access to healthcare or lifestyle factors, making it an indirect rather than direct association.<br/><br/><b>Consistent</b>: Consistency refers to the replication of an association across multiple studies, populations, and settings. While consistency strengthens the evidence for causality, it does not describe the nature of the association as direct or indirect.<br/><br/><b>Causal</b>: Causality requires additional criteria to be met, such as temporality and biological plausibility. While a direct association is often causal, causation is not the same as a direct association—it must be proven using frameworks like Susser’s and Bradford Hill’s criteria.<br/></div>
