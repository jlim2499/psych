The scatter plot displays a distinct curved pattern, suggesting a non-linear relationship between the variables. The points are not randomly scattered nor do they form a straight line, which indicates that the relationship is not linear.<br/><br/><b>No correlation</b> is incorrect because there is a discernible pattern in the scatter plot. The data points form a curved shape, indicating that there is an association between the variables.<br/><br/><b>Weak positive linear correlation</b> is incorrect because a weak positive linear correlation would show a slight upward trend in the data points forming a straight line, which is not evident in this plot. The data points follow a non-linear pattern instead.<br/><br/><b>Strong positive linear correlation</b> is incorrect because a strong positive linear correlation would show a tight clustering of data points around a straight line with a positive slope. The scatter plot clearly shows a curved pattern, indicating a non-linear relationship.<br/><br/><b>Weak linear correlation</b> is incorrect because a weak linear correlation, whether positive or negative, would suggest a slight trend in the data points forming a straight line. The scatter plot demonstrates a non-linear relationship.<br/></div>
