<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is a relative advantage of prospective versus retrospective cohort studies?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">They can assess exposures before the study begins</span></div><br/>In prospective cohort studies all the assessments of the exposures are done before the study begins. This gives the researchers more control over the risk factors. In retrospective cohort studies one must rely on the information gathered by other people in the past (usually for completely different purposes) so there is some element of approximation and guess work involved. This means that the study is more more prone to the effect of confounding factors.<br/><br/>Both prospective and retrospective methods can assess rare exposures, multiple exposures, and binary and continuous risk factors. Retrospective cohort studies are quicker as all the data is already available and no real-time follow up is required.<br/><br/><br/></div>
