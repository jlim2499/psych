<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>In a clinical trial comparing two antipsychotic medications, a p-value of 0.04 is reported. What does this p-value represent in the context of Type I error?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">4% probability that the observed difference is due to chance</span></div><br/><i><b>Previous Exam Question</b></i><br/><br/>The correct answer is <b>4% probability that the observed difference is due to chance</b>. A p-value of 0.04 means there is a 4% probability that the observed difference between the two antipsychotic medications occurred by chance, assuming the null hypothesis is true. In this context, a Type I error (false positive) would occur if the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected when it is actually true.<br/><br/><b>4% chance of concluding there is no difference when one exists</b>: This describes a Type II error (false negative), not a Type I error. A Type II error occurs when a real effect or difference is missed.<br/><br/><b>4% risk of a Type II error</b>: This is incorrect, as the p-value is related to the probability of making a Type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true), not a Type II error.<br/><br/><b>96% probability that the result is clinically significant</b>: The p-value does not provide information about clinical significance. It only indicates the statistical significance of the result, not its clinical importance or relevance.<br/><br/><b>96% chance of a Type I error</b>: This is incorrect, as the p-value of 0.04 indicates a 4% probability of making a Type I error if the null hypothesis is true. A 96% chance would be grossly misrepresenting the p-value.<br/></div>
