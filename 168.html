<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is a recognised approach used in qualitative research?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Grounded theory</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Grounded Theory</b>. Grounded Theory is a recognised qualitative research approach used to develop theory based on data collected from participants. It involves systematically gathering and analysing qualitative data, allowing theories to emerge directly from the data itself. This approach is widely used in qualitative research to explore complex social processes and understand participants' perspectives deeply.<br/><br/><b>Census survey</b>: A census survey is a quantitative method aimed at collecting data from an entire population or a large sample, typically involving structured questions. It is not used as a qualitative research approach, as it focuses on numerical data rather than in-depth insights.<br/><br/><b>Cross-sectional survey</b>: Cross-sectional surveys are commonly used in quantitative research to collect data at a single point in time. They are not typically used in qualitative research, as they are more focused on quantifying variables rather than exploring in-depth meanings or themes.<br/><br/><b>Factor analysis</b>: Factor analysis is a statistical technique used in quantitative research to identify underlying relationships between variables. It is not associated with qualitative research, as it requires numerical data and complex statistical computations.<br/><br/><b>Regression analysis</b>: Regression analysis is a quantitative method used to examine the relationships between dependent and independent variables. It is not a qualitative approach and is generally used to make predictions based on statistical models.<br/></div>
