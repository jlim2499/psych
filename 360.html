<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>The clinical director of a unit performs an economic evaluation study to identify which type of psychological therapy results in the greatest reduction in depressive symptoms (as assessed by the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale). He compares the costs of three different therapeutic approaches against the average reduction in depressive symptoms gained by each. Which method of economic evaluation has he used?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Cost-effectiveness analysis</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Cost-effectiveness analysis</b>. This method of economic evaluation is used when the costs of different interventions are compared against a common health outcome. In this case, the clinical director is comparing the costs of three different therapeutic approaches against one common health outcome - reduction in depressive symptoms as assessed by the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale. <br/><br/><b>Cost-benefit analysis</b>, on the other hand, compares costs and benefits but both are measured in monetary terms. This approach would necessitate assigning a monetary value to the reduction in depressive symptoms, which has not been done in this scenario.<br/><br/><b>Cost-utility analysis</b> also compares costs with health outcomes, but these outcomes are measured in terms of their utility or value to patients (e.g., quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] or disability-adjusted life years [DALYs]). Again, this isn't applicable here as the outcome measure is a specific symptom scale score rather than a measure of overall health utility.<br/><br/><b>Programmatic cost analysis</b> involves calculating all costs associated with an intervention without necessarily relating them to any specific outcomes. It provides information about where resources are being used but doesn't allow for comparison between different interventions based on their effectiveness or utility.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>Opportunity cost</b> refers to the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen. In healthcare economics, this might involve considering what other services could have been provided with the resources used for a particular intervention. However, it's not a type of economic evaluation per se and doesn't fit with what the clinical director is doing in this scenario.<br/></div>
