The study involves comparing the mean length of pregnancy in a sample of women with bipolar disorder to the known population mean. The data for the length of pregnancy is continuous and normally distributed. Which statistical test is most appropriate to use in this scenario?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">One sampled t-test</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>One sampled t-test</b>. The one-sample t-test is utilised to compare the mean of a single sample to a known population mean. This test assumes the data is continuous and normally distributed, as indicated in the question. In this case, the aim is to determine whether the mean length of pregnancy for women with bipolar disorder differs from the population mean.<br/><br/>5 Steps:<br/><br/>1) Define the research question: Does the mean pregnancy length for women with bipolar disorder differ from the population mean?<br/>2) Establish how many groups there are and if they are dependent or independent: There is one group (women with bipolar disorder) being compared to a population mean.<br/>3) Identify the variables and data types: The dependent variable is the length of pregnancy, which is continuous.<br/>4) Establish if the data is parametric or non-parametric: The data is continuous and normally distributed, allowing the use of a parametric test.<br/>5) Select the correct statistical test: Based on the above, the one-sample t-test is most appropriate.<br/><br/><b>Chi squared test</b>: The chi-squared test is used for categorical data to determine if there is an association between variables or if a sample differs from expected frequencies. It is not appropriate here as the data involves continuous measures (length of pregnancy).<br/><br/><b>Paired t-test</b>: The paired t-test compares means from the same group measured at two different times or under two conditions. This test is not suitable here because there is only one group, and no paired (pre- and post-) measurements are involved.<br/><br/><b>Independent sampled t-test</b>: The independent t-test compares the means of two separate groups. This test is not suitable because the study involves comparing one group to a population mean, not comparing two independent groups.<br/><br/><b>Mann Whitney U test</b>: The Mann Whitney U test is a non-parametric test used to compare medians between two independent groups when the data does not meet normality assumptions. This is unnecessary here as the data is normally distributed, and only one sample is being compared to the population mean.<br/></div>
