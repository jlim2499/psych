<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Regarding evidence based medicine, which of the following is an example of a foreground question?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">What is the effectiveness of restraints in reducing the occurrence of falls in patients 65 and over?</span></div><br/>If the answer to the question results in the ability to make a clinical decision the question is likely to be a foreground question. Background questions are broad in scope and rather general.<br/><br/>The correct answer is <b>What is the effectiveness of restraints in reducing the occurrence of falls in patients 65 and over?</b> Foreground questions are specific, patient-oriented queries that inform medical decisions for individual patients. They often ask about specific treatments or interventions, their efficacy, and potential harms. In this case, the question asks about a specific intervention (use of restraints) and its impact on a defined patient population (patients aged 65 and over).<br/><br/>The option <b>What is the evidence of the relationship between dementia and caffeine consumption?</b> is incorrect as it represents an example of a background question rather than a foreground question. Background questions seek to understand a condition, disease or health issue more generally. This type of query would typically be used to gather general information about dementia and caffeine consumption rather than informing direct clinical decision-making.<br/><br/><b>What is Aspergers Syndrome?</b> is also incorrect because it represents another example of a background question. It seeks to understand a condition or syndrome more generally rather than asking about specific treatments, interventions or outcomes related to individual patient care.<br/><br/>The option <b>What research is available on the issue of privacy related to computerised patient records?</b>, while an important topic in contemporary healthcare settings, is not considered a foreground question as it does not directly relate to individual patient care decisions. Instead, this question pertains to broader ethical and administrative considerations within healthcare systems.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>What is the best evidence available about managing side-effects when using clozapine?</b>, while seemingly close to being a foreground question because it discusses management strategies for side effects associated with clozapine use, does not specify any particular patient group or context. A true foreground question might instead ask: 'In adult patients diagnosed with schizophrenia resistant to other antipsychotic medications, how effective is clozapine at managing symptoms without causing severe side effects?'<br/></div>
