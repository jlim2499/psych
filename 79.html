<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following regarding disease rates is true?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Attributable risk is equal to the disease rate in exposed people minus that in unexposed people</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Attributable risk is equal to the disease rate in exposed people minus that in unexposed people</b>. This definition reflects the standard calculation of attributable risk (also called the risk difference). It measures the absolute increase in risk due to the exposure and helps identify how much of the risk in the exposed group can be directly attributed to the exposure. For example, if the incidence of lung cancer in smokers is 20 per 1,000 and in non-smokers is 5 per 1,000, then the attributable risk is 15 per 1,000. This measure is particularly useful in understanding the burden of disease caused by modifiable risk factors and is relevant in clinical and public health decision-making.<br/><br/><b>The terms risk ratio and attributable risk are synonymous</b> is incorrect. These are fundamentally different statistical concepts. The risk ratio (also called relative risk) is a ratio that compares the incidence of disease in the exposed group to the incidence in the unexposed group, indicating the strength of the association. In contrast, the attributable risk is a difference, measuring the additional risk due to the exposure. For example, if a disease occurs in 10% of exposed and 5% of unexposed individuals, the risk ratio is 2, but the attributable risk is 5%.<br/><br/><b>The population attributable risk is equal to the attributable risk divided by the prevalence of exposure to a risk factor</b> is incorrect. This statement misrepresents the formula. Population attributable risk (PAR) considers both the strength of the association and the proportion of the population that is exposed. The correct formula is:<br/>PAR = Attributable risk Ã— prevalence of exposure in the population, not divided by prevalence. This distinction matters because it influences estimates of the potential public health impact of removing a risk factor across an entire population.<br/><br/><b>Population attributable risk is the same as the incidence in exposed individuals</b> is incorrect. This is a misunderstanding of both terms. The incidence in exposed individuals refers to the total risk in the exposed group, regardless of whether the risk is due to the exposure. In contrast, the population attributable risk estimates the proportion of disease in the entire population (exposed and unexposed) that is attributable to the exposure. It accounts for how common the exposure is in the population and the risk it confers.<br/><br/><b>The odds ratio is synonymous with the risk ratio</b> is incorrect. Although the odds ratio and risk ratio may be similar when the outcome is rare, they diverge as outcome frequency increases. The risk ratio is easier to interpret clinically as it compares actual probabilities, while the odds ratio compares the odds of an event and tends to overestimate effect size, especially when the event is common. This distinction is important in interpreting findings from case-control studies (which use odds ratios) versus cohort studies (which usually use risk ratios).<br/></div>
