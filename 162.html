<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A researcher wants to determine if there is a linear relationship between a person's age (in years) and systolic blood pressure (in mmHg). The data is normally distributed for both variables, and the researcher begins by visualising the relationship using a scatter plot. Which of the following statistical tests would they use next to assess the strength and direction of this relationship?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Pearson's coefficient</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Pearson's coefficient</b>. Pearson's correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two continuous variables when the data is normally distributed.<br/><br/>5 Steps:<br/><br/>1) Define the Research Question: The researcher wants to determine if there is a linear relationship (correlation) between age (independent variable) and systolic blood pressure (dependent variable).<br/>2) Establish the Number of Groups and Dependency: There are no distinct groups. Instead, the analysis focuses on the relationship between two continuous variables.<br/>3) Identify the Variables and Data Types: Independent variable: Age (continuous, ratio scale). Dependent variable: Systolic blood pressure (continuous, ratio scale).<br/>4) Establish if Parametric or Non-Parametric Tests Should Be Used: Both variables are continuous and normally distributed, meeting the assumptions for a parametric test.<br/>5) Select the Statistical Test: Pearson's correlation coefficient is the appropriate statistical test for assessing the linear relationship between two continuous variables under these conditions.<br/><br/><b>ANOVA</b>: ANOVA is used to compare the means of three or more groups to determine if there are significant differences between them. In this scenario, the question is about the relationship between two variables rather than group differences, so ANOVA is inappropriate.<br/><br/><b>Mann Whitney U test</b>: This non-parametric test compares differences between two independent groups for ordinal or non-normally distributed continuous data. It is not suitable here, as the focus is on correlation, not group differences.<br/><br/><b>Chi squared</b>: The Chi-squared test assesses associations between categorical variables. Since both age and blood pressure are continuous variables, the Chi-squared test is not applicable.<br/><br/><b>T-test</b>: A t-test compares the means of two groups (independent or paired). This scenario does not involve group comparisons, so a t-test is not the correct choice.<br/></div>
