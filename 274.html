<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A patient has chronic pain following a road traffic accident (RTA) and is expected to live for 10 more years with a quality of life (QoL) weight of 0.4. What is the total Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) for this patient over the 10-year period?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">4 QALYs</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>4 QALYs</b>. Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) are calculated by multiplying the quality of life (QoL) weight by the duration of life expectancy. In this case, the QoL weight is 0.4, and the patient is expected to live for 10 years. Therefore, 0.4 Ã— 10 = 4 QALYs. This represents the total number of years adjusted for the reduced quality of life due to chronic pain.<br/></div>
