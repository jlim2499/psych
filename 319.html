<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>In a cohort study designed to examine the association between smoking and Alzheimer's dementia, which measure is typically used to describe the outcome?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Relative risk</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Cohort = relative risk<br/>Case-control = odds ratio</div>Explanation for the Correct Answer:<br/><br/>Relative risk is the correct option. In a cohort study, where two groups (e.g., smokers and non-smokers) are followed over time to see who develops a condition (e.g., Alzheimer's dementia), relative risk is the appropriate measure. It compares the risk of developing the disease in the exposed group (smokers) to the risk in the unexposed group (non-smokers).<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Odds ratio is typically used in case-control studies, not cohort studies, as it compares the odds of exposure in cases to the odds of exposure in controls.<br/><br/>Experimental event rate is not a standard term in epidemiology; the term 'incidence rate' might be used in cohort studies to describe the rate of new cases within the exposed group.<br/><br/>Absolute risk increase refers to the difference in risk between the exposed and unexposed groups, which is not typically the primary measure reported in cohort studies.<br/><br/>Numbers needed to harm is calculated from absolute risk increase and is used to represent how many patients need to be exposed to a risk factor for one additional person to be harmed; this is more common in clinical trials than observational studies.<br/></div>
