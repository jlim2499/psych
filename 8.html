This is an example of 'made volition', a first-rank symptom of schizophrenia. Made volition refers to the belief that one's actions or impulses are under the control of an external entity, rather than originating from the self. This is a hallmark of Schneiderian first-rank symptoms, which are strongly associated with schizophrenia and can help in diagnosing the disorder.<br/><br/><b>The patient provides one-word answers and appears to lack spontaneous speech, often saying very little in conversation</b>: This describes alogia, a negative symptom of schizophrenia characterised by poverty of speech and thought. While it is commonly seen in schizophrenia, it is not a first-rank symptom.<br/><br/><b>The patient rapidly switches from one topic to another in conversation, making it difficult to follow their train of thought</b>: This reflects flight of ideas, commonly associated with mania. Although it indicates disorganised thinking, it is not a first-rank symptom of schizophrenia.<br/><br/><b>The patient creates new words that do not make sense to others, which they use in regular conversation</b>: This is an example of neologisms, a symptom often seen in schizophrenia. However, it is not considered a first-rank symptom. Neologisms demonstrate thought disorder but lack the specific nature of first-rank symptoms.<br/><br/><b>The patient describes seeing non-existent people or objects, such as shadows or figures in the room</b>: Visual hallucinations involve seeing things that are not present and are more typical of organic brain disorders. In schizophrenia, auditory hallucinations are more common and are part of first-rank symptoms when they involve voices giving a running commentary, arguing, or thought echo, but visual hallucinations are not first-rank symptoms.<br/></div>
