A confidence interval is a range of values, derived from a statistical model, that is likely to contain the value of an unknown population parameter. The width of the confidence interval gives us some idea about how uncertain we are about the unknown parameter (a wide interval may indicate high uncertainty; a narrow interval, low uncertainty). When we decrease the confidence level from 95% to 90%, we are essentially saying that we are less confident that the true population mean lies within our specified range. Therefore, by decreasing our level of certainty, we also decrease the size or width of our confidence interval.<br/><br/>The option <b>Increase in positive direction only</b> and <b>Increase in negative direction only</b> are incorrect because changing the confidence level does not affect one direction more than another. The increase or decrease in size of a confidence interval happens symmetrically around the mean.<br/><br/>Similarly, <b>Increase in both a positive and negative direction</b> is also incorrect because decreasing the confidence level would actually lead to a decrease rather than an increase in the size of the confidence interval.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Not change</b> is incorrect as well. Changing the confidence level indeed changes size of the confidence interval. As mentioned before, if you decrease your level of certainty (i.e., go from a 95% to a 90% confidence level), you can expect your resulting confidence interval to be narrower (smaller).<br/></div>
