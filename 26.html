<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A study is performed looking at the validity of a new diagnostic test for epilepsy. The study designers are concerned that not all patients may receive the gold-standard existing test. What type of bias does this describe?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Work-up bias</span></div><br/>Explanation for the Correct Answer:<br/><br/>Work-up bias: This occurs when the selection of patients for a study is influenced by the results of a preliminary test. In the scenario described, the concern is that not all patients may receive the existing gold-standard test, which may lead to an overestimation or underestimation of the new test's validity. This form of bias is particularly relevant when a diagnostic test is being validated because the inclusion of patients can be skewed based on whether they received the gold-standard test.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Attention bias: This type of bias occurs when participants in a study are more likely to notice and report certain outcomes, which is not the concern described in the scenario.<br/><br/>Selection bias: This occurs when the participants selected for a study are not representative of the general population. While this can affect study validity, it is not specific to the issue of patients not receiving the gold-standard test as in the scenario.<br/><br/>Co-intervention bias: This happens when patients receive additional interventions alongside the intervention being studied, which can confound the results. It is not relevant to the scenario described.<br/><br/>Instrument bias: This refers to a systematic error caused by flaws in the measurement tool itself, not by the selection of patients for different tests.<br/></div>
