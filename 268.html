<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A new drug is trialled for the treatment of lung cancer. Drug A is given to 500 people with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer, and a placebo is given to 450 people with the same condition. After 5 years, 300 people who received Drug A were still alive, compared to 225 who received the placebo.<br/>What is the number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve one additional survivor after 5 years?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">10</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">NNT = 1 / ARR</div>The correct answer is <b>10</b>. The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is calculated as the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction (ARR). In this case, the survival rate with Drug A is 300 out of 500 = 60%, and the survival rate with placebo is 225 out of 450 = 50%. The absolute risk reduction is:<br/><br/>ARR = 60% − 50% = 10% (or 0.10)<br/>NNT = 1 ÷ ARR = 1 ÷ 0.10 = 10<br/><br/>This means that for every 10 people treated with Drug A, one additional person survives compared to those treated with placebo. This metric is critical in clinical decision-making, allowing psychiatrists and other clinicians to weigh the benefit of interventions in real-world terms and to prioritise treatments that offer meaningful outcome improvements.<br/><br/><b>3.33</b> is incorrect. This would be the NNT if the absolute difference in survival were 30%, but the difference here is only 10%. Misinterpreting the NNT can lead to overestimation of a drug's benefit.<br/><br/><b>75</b> is incorrect. An NNT this high would correspond to a marginal benefit (e.g. an ARR of ~1.3%), which is far smaller than the 10% observed here.<br/><br/><b>5</b> is incorrect. An NNT of 5 would correspond to an ARR of 20%. Here, the ARR is 10%, so this underestimates the number of people needed to treat.<br/><br/><b>2</b> is incorrect. This would reflect an ARR of 50%, meaning the treatment halves mortality — which is not supported by the data presented.<br/></div>
