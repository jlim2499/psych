A pandemic refers to a disease outbreak that has spread over multiple countries or continents, and affects a large number of people. The term is most commonly used in the context of influenza, as in the 1918 flu pandemic (H1N1 virus) or the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. It implies that the disease has spread globally and is causing serious illness on a wide scale.<br/><br/>In contrast, an <b>Endemic</b> refers to the constant presence of a disease within a particular geographic area or population group. In other words, it's an illness that's typically found among particular people or in a certain area. Malaria, for example, is endemic in some parts of Africa.<br/><br/><b>Megademic</b> is not a recognised term in epidemiology. It may be confused with 'hyperendemic', which describes a persistent, high level of disease occurrence.<br/><br/>An <b>Epidemic</b> refers to an increase, often sudden, in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in that population in that area. This term often applies to flu but can be used for any disease or condition. For instance, there was an epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) between November 2002 and July 2003.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>Polydemic</b> is also not a recognised term within epidemiology. While 'poly-' means many or much, it does not fit within the context of describing patterns of disease occurrence.<br/><br/>Therefore, when referring to a global outbreak of flu affecting numerous countries and populations across continents simultaneously we use the term '<i>pandemic</i>'.<br/></div>
