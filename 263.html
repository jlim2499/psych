After 5 years, 18 people who received the new drug had a further stroke compared to 10 people who just received aspirin. What is the number needed to treat?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">20</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">NNT = 1 / ARR</div>To find the number needed to treat (NNT), we first calculate the absolute risk reduction (ARR), which is the difference in the event rates between the control group and the treatment group.<br/><br/>From the information provided:<br/><br/>120 patients received the new drug, out of which 18 had a further stroke.<br/>50 patients (170 total - 120 treatment group = 50 control group) received just aspirin, out of which 10 had a further stroke.<br/>The event rate for the treatment group is 18/120, and for the control group, it's 10/50.<br/><br/>Let's calculate the ARR and subsequently the NNT.<br/><br/>The NNT is the inverse of the ARR (NNT = 1/ARR).<br/><br/>The number needed to treat (NNT) is '20'.<br/><br/>The absolute risk reduction (ARR) is calculated as the difference between the event rate in the control group (10/50 = 0.20 or 20%) and the event rate in the treatment group (18/120 = 0.15 or 15%). This gives an ARR of 0.05 or 5%. The NNT, which is the reciprocal of the ARR, is therefore 1/0.05, which equals 20. This means that 20 patients would need to be treated with the new antiplatelet drug in addition to aspirin to prevent one additional person from having a stroke, compared to aspirin alone.<br/></div>
