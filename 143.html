<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Consider the following study and then select the option below that best describes the type of study that was conducted.<br/>Objectives:<br/><br/>As a nation with a developing economy, Croatia is faced with making choices between pharmaceutical products, including depot injectable antipsychotics. We conducted a pharmacoeconomic analysis to determine the cost-effectiveness of atypical depots in Croatia.<br/><br/>Methods:<br/><br/>A 1-year decision-analytic framework modeled drug use. We determined the average direct cost to the Croatian Institute for Health Insurance of using depot formulations of paliperidone palmitate long-acting injectable (PP-LAI), risperidone LAI (RIS-LAI), or olanzapine LAI (OLZ-LAI). An expert panel plus literature-derived clinical rates populated the core model, along with costs adjusted to 2012 by using the Croatian consumer price index. Clinical outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years, hospitalization rates, emergency room treatment rates, and relapse days. Robustness of results was examined with one-way sensitivity analyses on important inputs; overall, all inputs were varied over 10,000 simulations in a Monte Carlo analysis.<br/><br/>Results:<br/><br/>Costs (quality-adjusted life-years) per patient were 5061 (0.817) for PP-LAI, 5168 (0.807) for RIS-LAI, and 6410 (0.812) for OLZ-LAI. PP-LAI had the fewest relapse days, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations. Results were sensitive against RIS-LAI with respect to drug costs and adherence rates, but were generally robust overall, dominating OLZ-LAI in 77.3% and RIS-LAI in 56.8% of the simulations.<br/><br/>Conclusions:<br/><br/>PP-LAI dominated the other drugs because it had the lowest cost and best clinical outcomes.<br/>Compared with depots of olanzapine and risperidone and oral olanzapine, PP-LAI was the cost-effective atypical LAI for treating chronic schizophrenia in Croatia. Using depot paliperidone in place of either olanzapine or risperidone would reduce the overall costs of<br/>caring for these patients.<br/><br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Cost-utility analysis</span></div><br/>Explanation for the correct option:<br/><br/>Cost-utility analysis is the correct option here. This type of pharmacoeconomic analysis is characterized by its use of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as a measure of the benefit provided by a healthcare intervention, allowing for the comparison of the relative value of different treatments. The study described aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of atypical depot antipsychotics in Croatia, utilizing QALYs as the clinical outcome, which is a hallmark of cost-utility analysis.<br/><br/>Incorrect options are:<br/><br/>Cost-consequences analysis is incorrect because this type of analysis lists all costs (inputs) and all consequences (outcomes) but does not aggregate them into a single outcome measure like cost-utility analysis does.<br/><br/>Cost-benefit analysis is incorrect because it involves comparing the monetary value of all costs and benefits of an intervention, typically resulting in a net monetary value or a benefit-to-cost ratio. The study in question uses QALYs, not monetary benefits.<br/><br/>Cost-effectiveness analysis is a broader term that could potentially apply, as it compares the relative costs and outcomes (effectiveness) of two or more courses of action. However, because the study specifically measures outcomes in QALYs, it is more accurately described as a cost-utility analysis.<br/><br/>Cost-minimisation analysis is incorrect because this analysis is used when two or more interventions have already been shown to be equivalent in their effectiveness, and the only consideration is which one costs less. The study described does not assume equivalent effectiveness but instead measures different clinical outcomes.<br/></div>
