<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A situation whereby a participant in a study behaves differently as they are aware they are under observation is known by which term?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Hawthorne effect</span></div><br/>The correct answer is the <b>Hawthorne effect</b>. This term originates from a study conducted at the Western Electric Hawthorne Works in Chicago, where it was observed that workers' productivity increased not as a consequence of actual changes in working conditions introduced by the plant's management, but because the workers were aware they were being observed. This phenomenon has been widely recognised and utilised in psychology and social sciences.<br/><br/><b>Smiths paradox</b> does not exist within the context of medical or social science studies. It might be a distractor invented for this question, so students should be aware that not all options given in multiple-choice questions are necessarily valid.<br/><br/><b>Ainsleys viewing fallacy</b> and <b>Murrays predicament</b> are also non-existent terms within the realm of medicine or social sciences. They serve as distractors in this question.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Simpsons paradox</b>, while being a valid statistical phenomenon, is unrelated to participant behaviour during a study. Simpson's Paradox occurs when a trend appears in different groups of data but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined. It is an example of an association paradox and highlights why data should always be analysed at the group level before drawing conclusions about an entire dataset.<br/></div>
