<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>As part of a research project you are trying to ascertain whether the use of dummies in infants is linked to sudden infant death syndrome. What is the most appropriate form of study design?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Case-control study</span></div><br/>The correct answer to this question is the <b>Case-control study</b>. This type of study is most appropriate in this scenario as it allows for the investigation of potential risk factors, such as dummy use, in relation to a specific outcome - in this case, sudden infant death syndrome. Case-control studies are retrospective and compare those with the disease (cases) to those without (controls), looking back in time to assess exposure to potential risk factors. This makes them particularly suitable for studying rare diseases or outcomes that take a long time to develop.<br/><br/><b>Randomised controlled trial</b> would not be an ethical or practical choice for this research question. In a randomised controlled trial, participants would need to be randomly assigned to either use a dummy or not, which could potentially expose infants to an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome if there is indeed a link. Furthermore, it would require large numbers of participants and long-term follow-up due to the rarity of the condition.<br/><br/>A <b>Cross-over trial</b> involves participants receiving multiple interventions over different periods. It's typically used when studying treatments for chronic conditions where the effect can be reversed by discontinuing treatment. It wouldn't be applicable here because you cannot switch between using and not using a dummy after a certain period and expect any effects on sudden infant death syndrome risk to reverse.<br/><br/>A <b>Cross-sectional survey</b>, while useful for assessing prevalence at one point in time, does not allow determination of causality because exposure and outcome are measured simultaneously. Therefore, it would not allow you to ascertain whether dummy use increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome.<br/><br/>Finally, although a <b>Cohort study</b> could theoretically be used – following two groups longitudinally (one exposed i.e., using dummies; one unexposed i.e., not using dummies) – its feasibility is limited by the rarity of sudden infant death syndrome and the large sample size that would be needed. It would also require a long follow-up period, making it less practical than a case-control study.<br/></div>
