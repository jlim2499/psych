Given the data set is skewed, as indicated by a single very high value of 45 DNAs (Did Not Attend) for one patient, the median will provide the most representative measure of the central tendency of this data. The median is less affected by outliers and skewed data than the mean.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Mean would normally be used to describe the average, but it is not appropriate in this case because it is highly sensitive to the outlier value of 45, which would distort the average.<br/><br/>Standard deviation is a measure of dispersion or variability within a data set, not central tendency, and does not describe the average by itself.<br/><br/>Variance, like standard deviation, measures the spread of data points and is also not a measure of central tendency.<br/><br/>Range only tells us about the spread between the lowest and highest values in the data set and does not provide a central value.<br/><br/>By choosing the median, we get a better 'central' value that is not unduly influenced by the outlier. Given the numbers presented, the median would be the most appropriate choice for describing the central tendency of this data set.<br/></div>
