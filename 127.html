<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A newly developed screening tool for early detection of schizophrenia is being considered for use in young adults. Which of the following criteria would need to be met to justify introducing this screening tool into routine practice?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">The condition is treatable and has an acceptable early intervention</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>The condition is treatable and has an acceptable early intervention</b>. According to Wilson and Jungner's criteria, screening is justified when a condition is treatable and effective early interventions are available. For schizophrenia, early intervention programs have shown potential in improving outcomes for young adults, including reducing relapse rates and improving functional recovery. This makes early detection valuable in a clinical setting.<br/><br/><b>The test has high sensitivity but poor specificity</b>: This is incorrect. While sensitivity is important in identifying individuals at risk, poor specificity would lead to a high rate of false positives, causing unnecessary anxiety and resource utilisation. Wilson and Jungner’s criteria emphasise the need for a balanced test that accurately identifies true cases.<br/><br/><b>The cost of case-finding is high relative to the healthcare system's budget</b>: This is incorrect. Screening should be economically balanced in relation to the healthcare budget, and high costs may make routine screening unsustainable. Cost-effectiveness is crucial in deciding whether to implement a screening tool.<br/><br/><b>Screening would be conducted once at the age of 18</b>: This is incorrect. Wilson and Jungner’s criteria support screening as an ongoing process, not a one-time event. Schizophrenia symptoms can emerge over a range of ages, so periodic screening may be more appropriate.<br/><br/><b>The natural history of schizophrenia, including its early and latent phases, is poorly understood</b>: This is incorrect. A thorough understanding of a condition's natural history, including any latent stages, is necessary for effective screening. Uncertainty about the progression of schizophrenia would limit the ability to screen effectively and intervene at the most beneficial points.<br/></div>
