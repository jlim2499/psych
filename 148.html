The weights of the participants (measured in kilograms) are recorded before starting olanzapine and then again two months later. The data for weight is continuous and normally distributed. Which statistical test is most appropriate to evaluate if there is a significant difference in weight before and after treatment?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Paired t-test</b> The correct answer is <b>Paired t-test</b>. The paired t-test is used to compare the means of a continuous variable measured at two time points for the same group of participants (e.g., before and after treatment), assuming the data is normally distributed.<br/><br/>Explanation with 5 Steps:<br/><br/>1) Define the research question: The study seeks to determine if there is a significant change in weight before and after two months of olanzapine treatment for the same group of patients.<br/>2) Establish how many groups there are and if they are dependent or independent: There is one group of patients, and weight is measured at two dependent time points (before and after treatment).<br/>3) Identify the variables and data types: Dependent variable: Weight (continuous).<br/>Independent variable: Time point (categorical with two levels: before and after treatment).<br/>4) Establish if parametric or non-parametric tests should be used: Since weight is a continuous variable and normally distributed, a parametric test (e.g., paired t-test) is appropriate.<br/>5) Select the correct statistical test: The paired t-test is the correct test for comparing means at two dependent time points when the data is normally distributed.<br/><br/>Explanation of Incorrect Options:<br/><br/><b>McNemar</b>: This test is used for paired categorical data, such as before-and-after studies where the outcome is binary (e.g., presence or absence of a symptom). It is not suitable for continuous data like weight.<br/><br/><b>Unpaired t-test</b>: The unpaired t-test is used to compare the means of a continuous variable between two independent groups. Since this study involves paired measurements (before and after treatment) for the same group, the unpaired t-test is not appropriate.<br/><br/><b>Friedman’s test</b>: This is a non-parametric test used to compare three or more related groups when the data does not meet the assumptions of normality. It is unnecessary here as the data is normally distributed, and there are only two time points.<br/><br/><b>Mann-Whitney U test</b>: This is a non-parametric test used to compare medians between two independent groups. It is not suitable for paired data or for normally distributed data.<br/><br/><b>Chi-squared</b>: The chi-squared test is used to analyse the association between two categorical variables. It cannot be used for continuous data like weight.<br/><br/><b>Wilcoxon signed ranks</b>: This non-parametric test compares paired data when the assumption of normality is not met. Since the data in this study is normally distributed, the paired t-test is more appropriate.<br/><br/><b>Kruskal-Wallis</b>: This non-parametric test is used to compare medians across three or more independent groups. It is not appropriate here as there are only two dependent time points.<br/><br/><b>ANOVA</b>: ANOVA is used to compare the means of a continuous variable across three or more independent groups. In this case, there are only two time points, so ANOVA is unnecessary.<br/><br/><b>Pearson’s test</b>: Pearson’s correlation assesses the strength of a linear relationship between two continuous variables. This is not relevant here as the study is investigating mean differences in a continuous variable across two time points.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>169.</b></td><td>A researcher investigates the effect of sertraline on patients with depression using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The BDI scores are measured at baseline (before treatment) and again three months after starting sertraline. The BDI scores are continuous but not normally distributed. Which statistical test is most appropriate to evaluate if there is a significant change in depression scores after treatment?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Wilcoxon signed ranks</b> The correct answer is <b>Wilcoxon signed ranks test</b>. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test is used for comparing paired continuous data when the assumption of normality is not met, making it ideal for this scenario.<br/><br/>Explanation with 5 Steps:<br/><br/>1) Define the research question: The study aims to determine whether sertraline significantly changes depression scores after three months of treatment.<br/>2) Establish how many groups there are and if they are dependent or independent: There is one group of patients, and depression scores are measured at two dependent time points (before and after treatment).<br/>3) Identify the variables and data types: Dependent variable: Depression scores (continuous, non-normally distributed). Independent variable: Time point (categorical with two levels: before and after treatment).<br/>4) Establish if parametric or non-parametric tests should be used: As the data is not normally distributed, a non-parametric test (e.g., Wilcoxon signed ranks test) is required.<br/>5) Select the correct statistical test: The Wilcoxon signed ranks test is the appropriate test for paired, non-normally distributed data.<br/><br/>Explanation of Incorrect Options:<br/><br/><b>McNemar</b>: This test is suitable for paired categorical data (e.g., binary outcomes such as 'improved' vs 'not improved'). It is not appropriate for continuous data like BDI scores.<br/><br/><b>Unpaired t-test</b>: The unpaired t-test is used for comparing the means of a continuous variable between two independent groups. It cannot be used for paired measurements or non-normally distributed data.<br/><br/><b>Friedman’s test</b>: This non-parametric test is used to compare three or more related groups. It is unnecessary here as there are only two time points being compared.<br/><br/><b>Mann-Whitney U test</b>: This non-parametric test is used to compare medians between two independent groups. It is not appropriate for paired data.<br/><br/><b>Chi-squared</b>: The chi-squared test is designed for categorical data, typically to assess the association between two categorical variables. It cannot be applied to continuous data like BDI scores.<br/><br/><b>Paired t-test</b>: The paired t-test is appropriate for comparing the means of paired continuous data that is normally distributed. Since the BDI scores are not normally distributed, the paired t-test is unsuitable.<br/><br/><b>Kruskal-Wallis</b>: This non-parametric test compares medians across three or more independent groups. It is not appropriate as this study involves paired data with two time points.<br/><br/><b>ANOVA</b>: ANOVA is used to compare the means of a continuous variable across three or more independent groups. It is unnecessary here as there are only two time points for the same group.<br/><br/><b>Pearson’s test</b>: Pearson’s correlation assesses the strength of a linear relationship between two continuous variables. It is not suitable for comparing paired data.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>170.</b></td><td>A study investigates the effect of different doses of clozapine on serum cholesterol levels. Three groups of patients receive varying doses of clozapine: 100 mg (Group A), 150 mg (Group B), and 200 mg (Group C). Five weeks after starting treatment, the mean rise in serum cholesterol levels is measured and compared between the groups to determine if higher doses of clozapine lead to greater increases in cholesterol. The data for the rise in cholesterol levels is continuous and follows a normal distribution.

One-way ANOVA is the appropriate test for comparing the means of a continuous variable (cholesterol rise) across three or more independent groups (doses of clozapine) when the data is normally distributed.<br/><br/>Explanation with 5 Steps:<br/><br/>1) Define the research question: The study aims to determine whether clozapine doses (100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg) are associated with differences in the rise in serum cholesterol levels.<br/>2) Establish how many groups there are and if they are dependent or independent: There are three independent groups based on the dose of clozapine.<br/>3) Identify the variables and data types: Dependent variable: Rise in cholesterol levels (continuous, normally distributed).
