<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is a descriptive statistic?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Standard deviation</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Standard deviation</b>. Standard deviation is a descriptive statistic that measures the spread or variability of a set of data around its mean. It summarises the degree to which data points deviate from the average, providing insight into the consistency of data. Descriptive statistics, like standard deviation, help in understanding and summarising data without making inferences or testing hypotheses.<br/><br/><b>Student's t-test</b>: This is incorrect. Student's t-test is an inferential statistic used to compare the means of two groups to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between them. Unlike descriptive statistics, it helps make inferences about populations based on sample data.<br/><br/><b>Chi-square test</b>: This is incorrect. The chi-square test is an inferential statistical test used to examine the association between categorical variables. It assesses whether observed frequencies differ from expected frequencies, making it a hypothesis-testing tool rather than a descriptive measure.<br/><br/><b>ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)</b>: This is incorrect. ANOVA is an inferential statistical test used to compare the means of three or more groups. It is employed to determine if there are significant differences among group means, which goes beyond merely describing data.<br/><br/><b>Regression analysis</b>: This is incorrect. Regression analysis is an inferential statistical method used to explore relationships between variables, often for prediction purposes. It analyses how one variable changes in response to another, providing more than just a description of data but also insights into causation or correlation.<br/></div>
