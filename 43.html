<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following describes a spurious association?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">A relationship that appears to exist but is caused by a confounder or random chance</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>A relationship that appears to exist but is caused by a confounder or random chance</b>. A spurious association occurs when two variables seem to be related, but this relationship is false or misleading, often due to confounding factors or random chance. For example, the correlation between ice cream sales and drowning deaths is spurious because both are influenced by hot weather, not by a direct or indirect relationship between the two variables.<br/><br/><b>A relationship supported by biological mechanisms</b>: This describes a plausible or coherent association rather than a spurious one. Biological plausibility strengthens the case for a causal link.<br/><br/><b>An association that reflects consistent findings across studies</b>: This is a feature of consistent associations as described by Bradford Hillâ€™s criteria. Consistency supports causation but is unrelated to spurious associations.<br/><br/><b>A direct causal relationship between two variables</b>: A direct causal relationship exists when one variable directly affects another without the influence of a confounder. This is the opposite of a spurious association.<br/><br/><b>A real relationship mediated by a third variable</b>: This describes an indirect association, where a true link exists but is mediated by a third factor, such as socioeconomic status affecting health outcomes via access to healthcare.<br/></div>
