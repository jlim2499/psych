Four individual studies in the forest plot have p-values less than 0.05, indicating statistical significance: Nemets 2002, Su 2003, Jazayeri 2008, and Gertsik 2012. These are clearly identified in the results table accompanying the forest plot. Understanding which studies reach significance is crucial when evaluating the consistency and strength of evidence across a meta-analysis. For psychiatrists appraising treatment efficacy—such as the impact of omega-3 fatty acids on depressive symptoms—this skill supports evidence-based recommendations and a critical approach to interpreting pooled results.<br/><br/><b>The pooled estimate is not significant</b> is incorrect. The pooled estimate, represented by the diamond at the bottom of the forest plot, has a confidence interval that does not cross zero, indicating statistical significance. Additionally, the associated p-value is 0.006. Recognising whether the overall effect is significant helps clinicians and policymakers determine whether a treatment or intervention is supported by the collective evidence of multiple trials.<br/><br/><b>The forest plot shows clear publication bias</b> is incorrect. Forest plots are not designed to detect publication bias; this requires a funnel plot to assess symmetry and potential small-study effects. Suggesting publication bias based solely on the forest plot is speculative and risks undermining the perceived reliability of the findings without proper statistical evaluation.<br/><br/><b>The studies by Bot and Lucas were not included in the pooled result</b> is incorrect. Both are clearly represented on the forest plot and have corresponding data in the results table, including effect sizes, confidence intervals, and p-values. They are included in the meta-analysis and contribute to the pooled effect estimate. Failing to recognise their inclusion could lead to misunderstanding the comprehensiveness of the analysis or overestimating positive findings.<br/><br/><b>The study by Su 2003 had the fewest number of participants</b> is incorrect. Although Su 2003 has a relatively large standard error (0.530), which suggests lower precision and possibly a smaller sample size, it is not definitively the smallest. For example, Nemets 2002 has an even larger standard error (0.537). Furthermore, while Su 2003 contributes significantly to the pooled result with a high effect size, its square box is not visible on the forest plot. This is because its effect size (2.067) and upper confidence limit (3.105) fall beyond the axis limit of +2.00, which is the maximum shown on the x-axis. In such cases, forest plots typically represent these studies with a horizontal line ending in an arrow, indicating that the point estimate and confidence interval extend beyond the displayed range. This is a standard visual convention and does not imply exclusion from the analysis. Understanding this nuance prevents clinicians from mistakenly assuming a study has been omitted when it simply lies beyond the scale.<br/></div>
