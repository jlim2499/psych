<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is true regarding percentiles?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Q1 is the 25th percentile</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Q1 is the 25th percentile</b>. In statistics, percentiles are used to understand and interpret data. The first quartile (Q1) is indeed the 25th percentile. This means that 25% of all values in a dataset fall below this value.<br/><br/>Now let's discuss each of the incorrect answers:<br/><br/><b>Q2 is given by the 75th percentile</b>: This statement is not accurate. Q2, also known as the median, actually represents the 50th percentile, not the 75th. This means that half of all values in a dataset fall below this value.<br/><br/><b>A score reported to be on 70th percentile means that this individual scored 70% on the test</b>: This interpretation of percentiles is incorrect. A score at the 70th percentile does not mean that an individual scored 70% on a test. Instead, it signifies that this individual scored higher than or equal to 70% of all other scores in a distribution.<br/><br/><b>The mean is always the 50th percentile</b>: This statement can be misleading. While it's true for some distributions (like a perfectly symmetrical bell curve), it's not universally applicable. In skewed distributions, for instance, where there are extreme high or low values, the mean can be pulled away from the median (the actual measure of the 50th percentile).<br/><br/><b>A score reported to be on 70th percentile means that 70% of all values lie above this value</b>: This statement is inaccurate. A score at the 70th percentile indicates that about 70% of all scores lie below this value - not above it.<br/><br/></div>
