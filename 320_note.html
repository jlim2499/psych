Non-parametric tests do not but are less powerful.<br/><br/>There are a variety of tests used to check that a distribution is normally distributed (only the most well known ones are listed)<br/><br/><ul><li>The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (Goodness-of-Fit) Test (when adapted specifically for this purpose it is sometimes referred to as the Lilliefor's test)</li><li>Jarque-Bera test</li><li>Wilk-Shapiro test</li><li>P-plot</li><li>Q-plot</li></ul><br/>Note also that if a data set is not normally distributed that sometimes it can be transformed to make it so (e.g. by taking a logarithm of the values).</div></div>
