The threshold value (called the alpha level) is conventionally set to 0.05.<br/><br/>The correct answer is the <b>Alpha level</b>. In statistics, the alpha level (also known as significance level) is the probability of rejecting a null hypothesis when it is true. It represents the threshold at which we decide to reject the null hypothesis. Commonly, researchers set an alpha level at 0.05, indicating a 5% risk of concluding that a difference exists when there is no actual difference.<br/><br/>The <b>Delta level</b> does not exist in statistical terminology and thus it's incorrect.<br/><br/>The term <b>Theta level</b> also doesn't exist within this context. Theta often denotes an unknown quantity in mathematics or physics but has no specific meaning in relation to hypothesis testing.<br/><br/>Similarly, there's no such term as <b>Omega level</b> within statistical analysis or hypothesis testing framework making it another wrong choice.<br/><br/>Lastly, the term <b>Beta level</b>, although it exists in statistical terminology, it refers to something different than what's asked in the question. Beta is used to denote Type II errors (false negatives), i.e., failing to reject a false null hypothesis. It does not represent the threshold for rejecting a null hypothesis and hence this option is incorrect.<br/><br/></div>
