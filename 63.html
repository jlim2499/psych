<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following test properties refers to the probability that a person who has the disease will test positive?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Sensitivity</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Sensitivity</b>. Sensitivity refers to the probability that a person who has the disease will test positive — in other words, the proportion of true positives among all those who actually have the condition. A test with high sensitivity is especially valuable for screening, as it minimises false negatives. In psychiatry, for example, a highly sensitive screening tool for postnatal depression ensures that most women with the condition are identified, even if a few false positives occur. This is crucial for early intervention in high-risk groups where missing a case could have serious consequences.<br/><br/><b>Precision</b> is incorrect. In the context of diagnostic testing, 'precision' is not a standard term used in clinical epidemiology. It may refer to the reproducibility or reliability of measurements, but it is not synonymous with sensitivity, specificity, or predictive values.<br/><br/><b>Negative predictive value</b> is incorrect. Negative predictive value (NPV) refers to the probability that a person with a negative test result truly does not have the disease. It depends on both the test's specificity and the prevalence of disease in the population.<br/><br/><b>Specificity</b> is incorrect. Specificity is the probability that a person without the disease will test negative — that is, the proportion of true negatives among those who are actually disease-free. It is the complementary property to sensitivity and is important when confirming diagnoses or avoiding overdiagnosis.<br/><br/><b>Positive predictive value</b> is incorrect. Positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that someone with a positive test result truly has the disease. Unlike sensitivity, which is an inherent property of the test, PPV varies with disease prevalence in the population being tested.<br/></div>
