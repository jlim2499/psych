The forest plot shows noticeable variation in effect sizes across the studies, as seen in the differing confidence intervals and the direction of effect sizes. Some studies strongly favour clozapine (negative values), while others do not, and the confidence intervals vary in width. This suggests that there are differences in the study populations, methodologies, or outcomes, which introduces heterogeneity. Recognising heterogeneity is essential in psychiatry, as it affects how generalisable the findings are to clinical practice. When heterogeneity is high, clinicians must be cautious in applying meta-analysis results directly to their patients.<br/><br/><b>The study by Klieser had more participants than that done by Rosenheck</b> is incorrect. In a forest plot, the size of the square represents the weight of the study, which is influenced by the sample size. The Klieser study has a smaller square than Rosenheck, indicating that it contributed less weight to the overall analysis, which usually means it had a smaller sample size. This is important clinically because larger studies provide more reliable estimates, reducing the impact of random variation.<br/><br/><b>All the studies used the same outcome measure</b> is incorrect. The forest plot does not provide information on whether all studies used the same outcome measure. Differences in rating scales, definitions of treatment response, or assessment criteria could contribute to the heterogeneity seen in the plot. This is clinically relevant, as varying outcome measures can make it difficult to compare studies directly and may influence treatment decisions based on meta-analysis findings.<br/><br/><b>Clozapine definitely works in treatment-resistant schizophrenia</b> is incorrect. While several studies favour clozapine (negative values), some confidence intervals cross zero, meaning their results are not statistically significant. This means we cannot conclude with certainty that clozapine is always superior. In clinical practice, clozapine remains the gold-standard treatment for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but patient response varies, and some may not tolerate the side effects.<br/><br/><b>Random effects modelling would produce a very different result</b> is incorrect. The plot does not provide enough information to determine whether a random-effects model would yield substantially different results from a fixed-effects model. A random-effects model accounts for between-study variability, which might slightly alter the combined estimate but would not necessarily produce a drastically different conclusion. This distinction is important in psychiatric research, as treatment effects can vary across different populations and settings.<br/></div>
