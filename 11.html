<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>The Clifton Assessment Procedure is an assessment tool used in which of the following settings?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Nursing homes for the elderly</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Nursing homes for the elderly</b>. The Clifton Assessment Procedure for the Elderly (CAPE) is specifically designed to assess the quality of life, cognitive deficits, and physical dependency levels in elderly patients. It is particularly useful in nursing homes where it can help in planning care and identifying areas of unmet need, ensuring that elderly residents receive appropriate support and interventions.<br/><br/><b>On hospital wards for people with a high risk of self harm</b> is not correct. While assessment tools are crucial in these settings, the CAPE is not designed for evaluating risk of self harm but rather for assessing cognitive and physical needs in the elderly.<br/><br/><b>Schizophrenia rehabilitation units</b> is incorrect. The CAPE is not intended for use in schizophrenia rehabilitation. These units require specialised tools that focus on the specific needs of patients with schizophrenia, such as evaluating the effectiveness of antipsychotic treatment and managing symptoms.<br/><br/><b>Prisons for substance abusers</b> is not accurate. The CAPE does not address the unique needs of substance abusers in prison settings. Instead, other assessment tools designed to evaluate addiction severity and readiness for treatment would be more appropriate.<br/><br/><b>Residential homes for people with learning disabilities</b> is also incorrect. The CAPE focuses on the elderly population, particularly those in nursing homes, rather than individuals with learning disabilities. Tools tailored to assess learning disabilities are more suitable for these residential settings.<br/></div>
