This type of study design is considered the gold standard for testing the efficacy of new treatments because it minimises bias, allowing for a causal relationship between the treatment and the outcome to be established.<br/><br/>Why the other options are incorrect:<br/><br/>'A cross-sectional study': This is an observational study design that analyses data from a population at a specific point in time. It does not involve any intervention and therefore cannot establish causality.<br/><br/>'A cohort study': This is also an observational study design where two or more groups (cohorts) are followed over time to assess the outcomes of interest. The groups may be exposed or non-exposed to a certain factor, but there is no random assignment to an intervention.<br/><br/>'An ecological study': This type of study looks at the relationships between exposure and outcome based on population-level data, rather than individual-level data. It is also observational and does not involve randomisation or controlled conditions.<br/><br/>'A case-control study': This observational study design involves identifying individuals with a specific outcome (cases) and a comparison group without the outcome (controls) and looking backwards to find exposures or risk factors. It does not involve the random allocation of an intervention.<br/></div>
