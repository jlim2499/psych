The data collected is categorical (developed agranulocytosis: yes/no) for both groups. Which statistical test is most appropriate to determine whether there is a significant difference in the proportions between the two groups?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Chi-squared test</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Chi-squared test</b>. The chi-squared test is used to evaluate the relationship between two categorical variables. In this case, the test compares the proportion of patients who develop agranulocytosis (yes/no) between the two treatment groups (clozapine vs olanzapine) to determine if there is a statistically significant difference.<br/><br/>The 5 Steps:<br/><br/>1) Define the research question: Is there a significant difference in the proportion of people who develop agranulocytosis between those treated with clozapine and those treated with olanzapine?<br/>2) Establish the number of groups and their relationship: Two independent groups: patients on clozapine and patients on olanzapine.<br/>3) Identify the variables and data types: Independent variable: Treatment group (clozapine vs olanzapine), categorical.<br/>Dependent variable: Agranulocytosis status (yes/no), categorical.<br/>4) Determine whether to use a parametric or non-parametric test: Since the data is categorical, a non-parametric test (chi-squared) is appropriate.<br/>5) Select the appropriate statistical test: The chi-squared test is the correct choice for analysing differences in proportions between the two independent groups.<br/><br/>Explanations for Incorrect Options:<br/><br/><b>Friedmanâ€™s test</b>: This is a non-parametric test for comparing repeated measures or matched groups. It is not suitable for comparing two independent groups with categorical data.<br/><br/><b>Mann-Whitney U test</b>: This is a non-parametric test for comparing the medians of two independent groups when the data is continuous or ordinal. It is not used for categorical data.<br/><br/><b>ANOVA</b>: ANOVA is used to compare the means of continuous data across three or more groups. It is not appropriate for analysing proportions or categorical data.<br/><br/><b>Paired t-test</b>: The paired t-test is used to compare the means of two related groups (e.g., before-and-after measures within the same group). It cannot be used for categorical data or independent groups.<br/></div>
