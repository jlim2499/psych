In other words, it's the probability that the test will detect an effect when there is one, or more technically,  1ˆ’β, where β is the probability of making a Type II error (failing to reject a false null hypothesis).<br/><br/>Why the other options are incorrect:<br/><br/>'Alpha level': Incorrect because the alpha level represents the probability of incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis (Type I error), not the probability of correctly rejecting a false one.<br/><br/>'The confidence coefficient': Incorrect as this term is not commonly used in the context of hypothesis testing for the power of a test. The confidence coefficient is related to the confidence level of confidence intervals, not hypothesis tests.<br/><br/>'Beta level': Incorrect because the beta level is actually the probability of making a Type II error, which is the opposite of the power of the test.<br/><br/>'The confidence level': Incorrect as this term refers to the percentage of time that a statistical result would be expected to fall within the specified range if the experiment were repeated multiple times. It does not specifically relate to the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis.<br/></div>
