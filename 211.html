The denominator for cumulative incidence must therefore be the number of people who are at risk of developing the disease at the start of the observation period. This excludes anyone who already has the disease or those who are not at risk.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>The total number of people in a population: This is incorrect because the total population may include individuals who already have the disease or are not at risk for other reasons, which would not be appropriate for calculating the cumulative incidence.<br/><br/>The number of new cases in a specified time period: The number of new cases is actually the numerator in the calculation of cumulative incidence, not the denominator.<br/><br/>The total person-time at risk during a specified time period: Total person-time at risk is used as the denominator for incidence rate, not cumulative incidence.<br/><br/>The number of cases in a defined population at a specified point in time: This is incorrect as it describes point prevalence rather than the denominator for cumulative incidence. Cumulative incidence is concerned with new cases over a period of time, not the total number of cases at a point in time.<br/></div>
