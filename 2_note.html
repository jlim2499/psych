It looks, smells and tastes like the active drug with which it is compared. The placebo effect is the observable improvement seen when a patient takes a placebo. The placebo effect results from patient related factors such as expectations rather than due to the placebo itself which is inert. <br/><br/>Where placebo's result in negative effects (due to patient related factors) this is termed the nocebo effect.<br/><br/>An active placebo is a treatment with a chemical activity that mimics the side effects of the drug that is being tested in a clinical trial. (Ozdemir, 2021) Active placebos are sometimes, but not always, used in clinical trials to prevent unblinding of the drug versus the placebo control group. For example, consider a new hypothetical antidepressant drug candidate in clinical trials that targets depression-related pathways in the brain, while also causing dry mouth as a side effect. An active placebo that elicits dry mouth as a side effect, but without effects on molecular targets in the brain or those related to depression, would help decrease the probability of unblinding in the course of the clinical trial.<br/><br/>A placebo need not always be pharmacological. It could be procedural, for example, sham electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), where the patient is anaesthetised but not given ECT.<br/><br/>Treatments that are perceived as being more powerful tend to have a stronger placebo effect than those that are perceived to be less so. Thus, placebo injections have more effect than oral placebos, capsules are perceived as being stronger than tablets, bright-coloured placebos are more effective than light-coloured ones larger placebos have more effect than smaller ones, and two placebos have more effect than one. Also, the status of the treating professional is directly related to the placebo effect. The same compound has been found to be more powerful if it is branded than when it is unbranded. <br/><br/>Among psychiatric disorders, the placebo effect has been most extensively studied in depression. Pattern analyses have shown that the improvement as a result of placebo in depression tends to be abrupt, occurs early in treatment and is less likely to persist, whereas improvement in response to antidepressants tends to be gradual, occurs later and is more likely to persist. Even among patients apparently responding to the active drug, if the pattern of improvement is consistent with a placebo response (i.e. abrupt and early), the improvement tends to be short-lived. <br/><br/>Placebo sag refers to a situation where the placebo effect is diminished (attenuated) with repeated use<br/><br/>The following facts about placebos in the Maudsley Guidelines (and therefore are likely to come up in the exams!)<br/><br/><ul><li>Placebo is not the same as no care (patients who maintain contact with services have a better outcome than those who receive no care)</li><li>The placebo response is greater in mild illness</li><li>The higher the placebo response rate the more difficult it is to power studies to show treatment effects</li><li>It is difficult to separate placebo effects from spontaneous remission</li><li>Patients who enter RCTs generally do so when acutely unwell.
