<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A study is designed to assess a new proton pump inhibitor (PPI) in elderly patients who are taking aspirin. The new PPI is given to 120 patients whilst a control group of 240 is given the standard PPI. Over a five year period 24 of the group receiving the new PPI had an upper GI bleed compared to 60 who received the standard PPI. What is the absolute risk reduction?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">5%</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">ARR = CER - EER</div>The correct answer is <b>5%</b>. This represents the absolute risk reduction (ARR), calculated by subtracting the risk in the intervention group from the risk in the control group.<br/><br/>Here's the breakdown:<br/><br/>In the new PPI group, 24 out of 120 patients experienced an upper GI bleed, which gives an event rate of 24/120 = 0.2 (or 20%).<br/>In the control group, 60 out of 240 patients experienced an upper GI bleed, giving an event rate of 60/240 = 0.25 (or 25%).<br/><br/>ARR = Control Event Rate (CER) - Experimental Event Rate (EER)<br/><br/>= 0.25 - 0.2<br/>= 0.05 (or 5%).<br/><br/>Thus, the absolute risk reduction is 5%.<br/><br/><b>15%</b>: This option likely confuses ARR with relative risk reduction (RRR). RRR would be calculated using the formula (CER - EER) / CER, but the question specifically asks for ARR, not RRR.<br/><br/><b>10%</b>: This is incorrect and might result from a misunderstanding of how to calculate the absolute difference in event rates between the two groups. The correct difference is 5%.<br/><br/><b>12</b>: This is not a percentage and does not represent a valid way to express absolute risk reduction. ARR is expressed as a percentage or proportion, not a whole number.<br/><br/><b>83.7%</b>: This is a distractor. It could confuse someone into thinking it's related to a more complex calculation like relative risk or relative risk reduction, but it's far from the correct calculation for ARR.<br/></div>
