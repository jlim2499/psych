<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Consider the following study and then select the option that best describes the study type?<br/>Context:<br/><br/>Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are prescribed for psychosis, aggression, and agitation in Alzheimer disease (AD).<br/><br/>Objective:<br/><br/>To conduct an analysis of SGAs and placebo (taken to represent a watchful waiting treatment strategy) for psychosis and aggression in outpatients with AD.<br/><br/>Design:<br/><br/>Randomized placebo-controlled trial of alternative SGA initiation strategies.<br/><br/>Setting:<br/><br/>Forty-two outpatient clinics.<br/><br/>Participants:<br/><br/>Outpatients with AD and psychosis, aggression, or agitation (N = 421).<br/><br/>Intervention:<br/><br/>Participants were randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine, quetiapine fumarate, risperidone, or placebo with the option of double-blind re-randomization to another antipsychotic or citalopram hydrobromide or open treatment over 9 months.<br/><br/>Main Outcome Measures:<br/><br/>Monthly interviews documented health service use and costs. The economic perspective addressed total health care and medication costs. Costs of study drugs were estimated from wholesale prices with adjustment for discounts and rebates. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were assessed with the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 and were supplemented with measures of functioning, activities of daily living, and quality of life. Analysis was conducted using the net health benefits approach in a sensitivity analysis in which QALYs were valued at $50 000 per year and $100 000 per year.<br/><br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Cost-benefit analysis</span></div><br/>The main outcome is the net benefit expressed in $. This question may have caught people out who assumed that the study type was a cost-utilitty analysis given that QALYs were used. <br/><br/>Sometimes QALYs are converted to a monetary value to enable a cost-benefit analysis to follow (as in this case).<br/><br/>Study details:<br/><br/><i>Rosenheck (2007) Cost-Benefit Analysis of Second-Generation Antipsychotics and Placebo in a Randomized Trial of the Treatment of Psychosis and Aggression in Alzheimer Disease.
