This type of study cannot lead to conclusions about causation as one would not be sure if the risk factor (smoking) preceded or followed the outcome (depression).  However if very high rates of smoking were found in people with depression it may warrant further study in this area.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>206.</b></td><td>A researcher collects information on a small number of patients who have all been regular users of a new designer drug nothing of which is known.
