<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>In a qualitative study on women who self-harm, 7 subjects are recruited with the following ages, 18, 22, 40, 17, 23, 18, and 44.  What is the modal age of women in the study.<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">18</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>18</b>. In statistics, the mode refers to the value that appears most frequently in a data set. In this case, the age 18 appears twice among the subjects recruited for the study, which is more frequent than any other ages listed. Therefore, 18 is the modal age of women in this particular study on self-harm.<br/><br/>Discussing each of the incorrect options:<br/><br/><b>26</b> is not present in the dataset at all. Therefore it cannot be considered as a modal value.<br/><br/><b>31</b>, like 26, does not appear in our dataset and hence cannot be considered as a mode.<br/><br/><b>23</b> only appears once among the ages of participants. While it's part of our dataset, it's not repeated and therefore doesn't qualify as a mode.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>22</b>, although it also forms part of our dataset with its single occurrence, does not qualify as a mode since there are no repeated instances of this age.<br/><br/>It's important to note that datasets can have more than one mode (in which case they would be bimodal or multimodal), but in this specific instance there is only one modal value: 18.<br/></div>
