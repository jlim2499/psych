Randomisation is a method used in the design phase of a study to reduce confounding factors. By randomly assigning participants to different groups, researchers aim to ensure that any differences observed between these groups can be attributed solely to the intervention under investigation, rather than any other variables.<br/><br/><b>Stratification</b>, while also aiming to control for confounding factors, does not do this at the design stage of a study. Instead, it involves dividing participants into subgroups or 'strata' based on certain characteristics (e.g., age, gender), and then conducting separate analyses for each stratum. This allows researchers to examine whether the effects of an intervention differ between different subgroups.<br/><br/><b>Bias sampling</b> refers to a process where some members of a population are more likely to be included in a sample than others, leading to a sample that is not representative of the population as a whole. This can introduce bias into a study and does not address confounding factors in its design.<br/><br/><b>Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)</b> is an analytical technique used after data collection has taken place. It adjusts for potential confounders by including them as covariates in an analysis model. While it controls for confounding factors, it does so at the analysis stage rather than during the design phase.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Funnel plots</b> are graphical tools used in meta-analyses and systematic reviews to assess publication bias - they do not address confounding factors at all. In these plots, each point represents a separate study included in the review or meta-analysis; studies with larger sample sizes (and thus greater precision) appear towards the top of the plot, while smaller studies appear towards the bottom. If there is no publication bias present, the plot should resemble an inverted funnel; if there is bias (e.g., due to smaller studies with negative results being less likely to be published), the plot will appear asymmetrical.<br/></div>
