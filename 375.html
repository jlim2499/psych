Smaller p-values indicate more evidence against the null hypothesis and in support of the alternative hypothesis. A p-value measures the probability of obtaining an effect at least as extreme as the one in your sample data, assuming the null hypothesis is true. Therefore, a small p-value suggests that the observed effect is unlikely to have occurred if the null hypothesis were true, which in turn supports the alternative hypothesis.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Bias: A p-value does not provide information about bias in the study design or data collection. Bias is a separate issue that must be addressed through study methodology.<br/><br/>The null hypothesis: Smaller p-values actually suggest evidence against the null hypothesis, not in support of it.<br/><br/>The quality of the study: The p-value does not reflect the quality of the study. A study can be well-designed and still result in a high p-value or poorly designed and result in a small p-value.<br/><br/>Further testing: While smaller p-values may lead researchers to feel more confident in their results, they don't inherently call for further testing. Decisions about further testing are based on a combination of statistical results and scientific judgment.<br/></div>
