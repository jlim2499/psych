<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>In which of the following sampling methods does the researcher ask the research participants to identify other potential research participants?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Snowball sampling</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Snowball sampling</b>. In snowball sampling, the researcher recruits initial participants who then propose other potential participants. This technique is particularly useful when studying populations that are difficult to access or locate, such as people with rare diseases or stigmatised conditions. It's called 'snowball' because, like a snowball rolling downhill gathering more snow, the sample size grows as existing study subjects recruit future subjects from among their acquaintances.<br/><br/><b>Convenience sampling</b> is incorrect because this method involves selecting individuals who are easiest to reach or most readily available. While it can be quick and easy, it often leads to biased results as the sample may not be representative of the wider population.<br/><br/><b>Quota sampling</b> is also incorrect. Quota sampling involves identifying subgroups in the population and setting quotas for individuals to be sampled from each subgroup. The selection within each subgroup can be random or convenient but does not involve participants identifying other potential research participants.<br/><br/><b>Stratified sampling</b>, another incorrect choice, entails dividing the population into homogeneous subgroups (or strata) based on specific characteristics (e.g., age, gender). Then a simple random sample is drawn from each stratum. Unlike snowball sampling, stratified sampling does not rely on participant referrals.<br/><br/>The last incorrect option is <b>Cluster sampling</b>. In this approach, the entire population is divided into groups, or clusters. A random sample of these clusters is selected, and all individuals within chosen clusters become part of the sample. This differs from snowballing where only certain members identified by previous participants are included in the sample.<br/></div>
