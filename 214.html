<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which one of the following statements regarding the normal distribution is correct?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Mean = mode = median</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Mean = mode = median</b>. This statement correctly describes a key property of the normal distribution, which is that it is symmetrical around its central value, where the mean, mode, and median are all equal.<br/><br/><b>Is a discrete probability distribution</b>. This statement is incorrect. The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution, not a discrete one. A continuous distribution means that the variable can take an infinite number of possible values within a given range.<br/><br/><b>99.7% of values lie within 2 standard deviations of the mean</b>. This statement is incorrect. According to the empirical rule for normal distributions, approximately 95.4% of the values lie within 2 standard deviations of the mean. About 99.7% of values lie within 3 standard deviations of the mean.<br/><br/><b>Standard deviation = mean / square root (variance)</b>. This statement is incorrect. The standard deviation is actually the square root of the variance, not the mean divided by the square root of the variance.<br/><br/><b>Is also referred to as the binomial distribution</b>. This statement is incorrect. The normal distribution is not the same as the binomial distribution. The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. The normal distribution is a continuous distribution often used to model natural phenomena.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/><br/>The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetrical around its mean, where the mean, mode, and median are all equal. This property distinguishes it from other distributions and is key to many statistical analyses. Other statements provided do not accurately describe properties of the normal distribution.<br/></div>
