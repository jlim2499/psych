Italy is the main outlier in the graph, showing a lower percentage of mental illness despite having a relatively moderate level of income inequality. This deviates from the general trend where higher income inequality is associated with a higher percentage of mental illness.<br/><br/><b>Germany</b> is incorrect because it follows the general trend where lower income inequality is associated with a lower percentage of mental illness.<br/><br/><b>Spain</b> is incorrect because it also follows the general trend and is not an outlier.<br/><br/><b>USA</b> is incorrect because while it has a high percentage of mental illness and high income inequality, it is part of the overall pattern, albeit on the higher end.<br/><br/><b>Japan</b> is incorrect because it follows the expected pattern of lower income inequality correlating with a lower percentage of mental illness.<br/></div>
