In a negatively skewed (left-skewed) distribution, the bulk of the data is concentrated on the higher end, with a longer tail on the left side (negative direction). As a result, the mean is pulled towards the tail, making it smaller than the median, while the mode, being the most frequently occurring value, remains at the peak of the data distribution, higher than the mean. Understanding skewness is essential in interpreting clinical datasets such as patient outcomes, where extreme low values can significantly affect the mean.<br/><br/><b>The mean is greater than the median</b> is incorrect. This is characteristic of a positively skewed (right-skewed) distribution where the tail is on the right, causing the mean to shift upwards. For example, in income distributions, extremely high incomes can elevate the mean above the median, whereas in negatively skewed distributions, the mean is typically lower.<br/><br/><b>The tail is longer on the right side</b> is incorrect. This describes a positively skewed distribution. A negatively skewed distribution is defined by a tail that extends to the left. For instance, this could apply to datasets like age at death in certain populations, where the tail might represent a small number of younger deaths pulling the mean downward.<br/><br/><b>The median is greater than the mode</b> is incorrect. In a negatively skewed distribution, the mode is at the peak of the distribution, followed by the median and then the mean, making the median smaller than the mode. For clinicians, understanding this hierarchy can be helpful when analysing metrics like test scores or symptom severity scales.<br/><br/><b>The mean equals the mode</b> is incorrect. This occurs in a perfectly symmetrical (normal) distribution. In skewed distributions, the mean, median, and mode are distinct, with their relative positions determined by the direction of skewness. Recognising these distinctions is critical for evaluating data summaries in clinical practice, such as averages in patient-reported outcomes.<br/></div>
