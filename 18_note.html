Rarely it can be seen in schizophrenia.<br/>Metamorphosia (object appears irregular in shape).<br/><br/><b>SENSORY DECEPTIONS</b><br/><br/>These include illusions and hallucinations.<br/><br/><b>Illusions</b><br/><br/>An illusion is an altered perception of a stimulus and differs from a hallucination in that in hallucinations there is no stimulus.<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid1"><thead><tr><th>Illusion type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Completion</td><td>The tendency to fill in missing information in order to make sense of a stimulus</td></tr><tr><td>Affect</td><td>Arise due to specific mood (affective) states e.g. a woman is walking home in the dark and is frightened, she mistakes a tree for a tall man in a long coat. Another example is an agitated person misinterpreting innocent gestures as threatening</td></tr><tr><td>Pareidolic</td><td>Arise when detailed images are seen from shapes.  E.g. seeing the man in the moon, or Jesus Christ on a piece of burnt toast.<br/><br/>Pareidolic illusions tend to occur when a person is concentrating whereas affect and completion illusions occur during inattention.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/><b>Hallucinations</b><br/><br/>A hallucination is a perception in the absence of a stimulus.<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid2"><thead><tr><th>Types of hallucination</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Elementary</td><td>These involve the perception of simple sensory experiences, such as flashes of light, colors, or simple shapes in the visual modality, or simple sounds like ringing or buzzing in the auditory modality. They are often associated with neurological conditions</td></tr><tr><td>Auditory</td><td>These can be first person where a patient hears their own thoughts, second person where a patient hears a voice talk directly to them, or third person where a patient hears voice having a discussion. Echo de la pensee (thought echo) refers to hearing aloud ones own thoughts a short time after thinking them. Similar to the experience of thought echo is that of Gedankenlautwerden, in which the patients hear their own thoughts aloud at the time they think them</td></tr><tr><td>Visual</td><td>These are more common in organic condition such as temporal lobe epilepsy and drug intoxication</td></tr><tr><td>Gustatory</td><td>These refer to hallucinations of taste</td></tr><tr><td>Olfactory</td><td>These refer to hallucinations of smell</td></tr><tr><td>Tactile (haptic)</td><td>These refer to false perceptions of touch</td></tr><tr><td>Functional hallucinations</td><td>A patient experiences an hallucination at the same time as receiving a real stimulus in the same sensory modality</td></tr><tr><td>Extracampine</td><td>These are hallucinations beyond the possible sensory field</td></tr><tr><td>Reflex</td><td>These occur in one sensory modality in response to a real stimulus in another sensory modality</td></tr><tr><td>Hypnopompic</td><td>These occur as a patient is waking from sleep (these are normal experiences)</td></tr><tr><td>Hypnagogic</td><td>These occur as a patient is going to sleep (these are normal experiences)</td></tr><tr><td>Lilliputian</td><td>These are visual hallucinations whereby the patient experiences seeing people who appear reduced in size or dwarfed</td></tr><tr><td>Kinaesthetic</td><td>These relate to hallucinations of muscle or joint sense. Patient's may describe that their limbs are being twisted or bent, or their muscles squeezed. They may also described being rocked about</td></tr><tr><td>Autoscopic</td><td>This refers to a person's experience of seeing a double of themselves in extrapersonal space without the experience of leaving ones body (no disembodiment)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/><b>Pseudohallucinations versus hallucinations</b><br/><br/>The following table illustrates the key differences between true hallucinations and fantasy/ imagery (Sims, 2003). Pseudohallucinations are thought to lie somewhere between the two on a spectrum.<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid3"><thead><tr><th></th><th>True hallucination</th><th>Fantasy/ imagery</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Experience</td><td>Concrete, real</td><td>Subjective</td></tr><tr><td>Location</td><td>Outer objective space</td><td>Inner subjective space</td></tr><tr><td>Definition</td><td>Definite outlines, complete sound</td><td>Incomplete</td></tr><tr><td>Vividness</td><td>Full, fresh, bright</td><td>Elements dim or neutral</td></tr><tr><td>Constancy</td><td>Retained</td><td>Evanescent (fades quickly)</td></tr><tr><td>Independence from volition</td><td>Cannot be dismissed, or changed at will</td><td>Requires voluntary creation</td></tr><tr><td>Insight</td><td>No distinction made between perception and hallucination</td><td>Fantasy has quality of idea</td></tr><tr><td>Behavioural relevance</td><td>Relevant to emotions, needs, actions</td><td>Not relevant</td></tr><tr><td>Sensory modality</td><td>Could experience object in another modality</td><td>Could not experience object in another modality</td></tr><tr><td>Existence</td><td>Object exists independent of observer</td><td>Depends on observer for existence</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>Pseudohallucinations are involuntary and vivid sensory experiences that are interpreted in a non-morbid way. As such, the key differentiator is that in pseudohallucinations the individual is able to recognise that the experience is an internally generated event. <br/><br/>They are said to occur in inner space (the patient may say they hear voices in their head). They may be retained for some time and cannot be deliberately evoked. They can occur in visual, auditory and tactile modalities. The term non-psychotic hallucination is often preferred to pseudohallucination.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/><i>A (2003) Symptoms of the mind. An introduction to descriptive psychopathology.
