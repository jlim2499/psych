Lead time bias is a type of information bias, which occurs when there is a systematic error in the way information is gathered or presented. In the case of lead time bias, earlier detection (often through screening) gives the appearance of longer survival without actually extending life. Clinically, lead time bias can affect decision-making in terms of how the effectiveness of a screening test is interpreted, potentially leading to unnecessary interventions if earlier detection is confused with improved outcomes.<br/><br/>Information bias refers to errors in measurement or data collection that lead to incorrect conclusions. It affects the quality or accuracy of the information gathered during a study. In lead time bias, for example, the information about survival time is skewed by earlier diagnosis, creating a misleading impression of benefit.<br/><br/>On the other hand, selection bias occurs when the participants or data points included in a study are not representative of the broader population, often due to how individuals are selected into or out of the study. This can distort the findings and lead to incorrect conclusions about relationships between variables.<br/><br/><b>Neyman bias</b> (also known as prevalence-incidence bias) is a type of selection bias. It occurs when certain cases, particularly those that are short-lived or rapidly fatal, are systematically excluded from a study. This can lead to an underestimation of the prevalence of more severe conditions because only longer-duration cases are represented. It does not involve the distortion of information itself, but rather the way participants are selected.<br/><br/><b>Loss to follow-up bias</b> is also a form of selection bias. It arises when participants who drop out of a study differ in significant ways from those who remain, potentially skewing results. This does not involve errors in the information being gathered, but in who is available to provide that information.<br/><br/><b>Citation bias</b> is another example of selection bias, not information bias. It occurs when studies with positive or significant results are more likely to be cited than those with negative or non-significant findings, which can distort the body of evidence in a field.<br/><br/><b>Admission rate bias</b> (Berkson's bias) is yet another form of selection bias. It happens when certain individuals are more likely to be included in a study based on their need for hospital care, leading to unrepresentative samples of the general population.<br/><br/>In summary:<br/><br/>Information bias involves errors in how information is collected or measured.<br/>Selection bias involves errors in how participants or data points are chosen for a study.<br/></div>
