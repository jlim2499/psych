<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A range of 3 standard deviations above and below the mean includes what percentage of the values?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">99.7%</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>99.7%</b>. This is a fundamental principle of statistics, specifically the rule of normal distribution or bell curve. According to this rule, approximately 68.2% of values fall within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95.4% fall within two standard deviations, and around 99.7% lie within three standard deviations. This principle is crucial in many areas of medicine, including laboratory reference ranges and population health studies.<br/><br/>The first option, <b>97.8%</b>, is incorrect. There's no standard statistical rule that corresponds to this percentage in terms of standard deviations from the mean.<br/><br/>The second option, <b>68.2%</b>, represents the proportion of values that fall within one standard deviation from the mean in a normally distributed dataset. It's incorrect in this context because the question asks about the range encompassing three standard deviations.<br/><br/>The third option, <b>72.4%</b>, doesn't correspond to any commonly used rule for percentages of values within certain numbers of standard deviations from the mean in a normal distribution.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>95.4%</b> represents approximately the percentage of values that fall within two standard deviations from the mean in a normally distributed dataset - not three as asked by the question.<br/><br/>Understanding these principles can help medical students interpret data correctly and make accurate predictions based on statistical models.<br/><br/></div>
