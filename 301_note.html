They query specialised and distinct knowledge needed for specific and relevant clinical decision-making (e.g. does hand washing in healthcare workers reduce hospital acquired infection?)<br/><br/><b>Formulating the question</b><br/><br/>When addressing foreground questions the components of the search question are generally defined using the PICO system.<br/><br/>Patient (P)  What is the patient group of interest?<br/>Intervention (I)  What is the intervention of interest?<br/>Comparison (C)  What is the comparison?<br/>Outcome (O)  What is the primary outcome?<br/><br/>The following table illustrates the PICO breakdown of the foreground question, does hand washing in healthcare workers reduce hospital acquired infection?<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid1"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>P (problem/patient/population)</td><td>hospital acquired infection</td></tr><tr><td>I (intervention/indicator)</td><td>hand washing</td></tr><tr><td>C (comparison)</td><td>no hand washing; other solution; masks</td></tr><tr><td>O (outcome of interest)</td><td>reduced infection</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/><b>Searching for the evidence</b><br/><br/>Firstly you need to have a basic understanding of the types of evidence you will be searching for.<br/><br/><b>Types of evidence (sources of information)</b><br/><br/>Scientific literature is divided into two basic categories:<br/><br/><ul><li>Primary (aka empirical research) - sources that contain the original data and analysis from research studies. No outside evaluation or interpretation is provided (e.g. RCTs, cohort studies, case-control studies, case-series, and conference papers).</li><li>Secondary - sources that interpret and analyse primary sources. These sources are one or more steps removed from the event (e.g. evidenced based guidelines and textbooks, meta-analysis and systematic reviews).</li></ul><br/><b>Filtered and unfiltered resources</b><br/><br/>Unfiltered Sources:<br/><br/>Unfiltered sources are large databases of articles that have not been pre-screened for quality. The searcher must filter out the results that do not meet their requirements using either specific vocabulary terms of pre-formulated searches or terms by the database.<br/><br/>When trying to answer foreground questions, it if often necessary to search the primary literature for original research articles. In behavioural health, these studies are found in a number of literature databases, including Medline (PubMed), PsycInfo, CINAHL and EMBASE.<br/><br/>This type of search can be quite a challenge. Besides needing to locate and master multiple sources, many of the articles included in these databases are not evidence-based. Special search strategies and techniques are needed to filter through the many references to find patient-centred, systematically researched studies.<br/><br/>Filtered Sources:<br/><br/>Filtered resources summarize and appraise evidence from several studies and included systematic reviews, critically appraised topics, evidence-based guidelines and point of care references.<br/><br/><b>Databases and search engines</b><br/><br/>Medline and Pubmed:<br/><br/>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) dates back to the late 1890s. It began with the simple acquisition, cataloguing, and indexing of the literature of the medical sciences. This was originally distributed in print. In 1964, the NLM then created a computer-oriented bibliographic retrieval and publication system called MEDLARS, an acronym for Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System. In 1971, MEDLINE (MEDlars onLINE) was launched. MEDLINE allowed re-mote users access to MEDLARS. MEDLINE was made available on the worldwide web in the early 1990s.<br/><br/>MEDLINE records are usually created from electronic metadata sent by journal publishers to the NLM. However, indexing is still manually added to article entries by staff at the NLM. This indexing includes basic error checking and the allocation of MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) descriptors to each article based on its content (MeSH terms are descriptors developed by librarians to organize and categorize topics).<br/><br/>MeSH is the NLMs controlled vocabulary thesaurus that consists of sets of descriptive terms organised in a hierarchical structure that allow searching at various levels of specificity.<br/><br/>There is much confusion about the difference between MEDLINE and PubMed. PubMed is actually a larger database run by the National Centre for Biotechnology information (NCBI) a sub-section of the NLM, of which MEDLINE is the largest component.<br/><br/>In addition to the Medline subset, PubMed also contains:<br/><br/><ul><li>In progress records (those not yet indexed into Medline)</li><li>Older records</li><li>Records considered out the scope of Medline (e.g. general chemistry and non-life science)</li></ul><br/>Embase:<br/><br/>Embase (Excerpta Medica database) is a large European database. Embase and Medline have an overlap of 30-50%.<br/><br/>Compared with Medline, Embase provides a greater coverage of European and non-English language publications. It also covers a broader range of topics concerned with pharmaceuticals, psychiatry, toxicology, and alternative medicine. <br/><br/>The Cochrane Library:<br/><br/>The Cochrane library is a collection of six databases. These include:<br/><br/><ul><li>The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) - peer-reviewed systematic reviews prepared by Cochrane Review Groups</li><li>The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) - Contains quality-assessed abstracts of systematic reviews (those reviews not prepared by the Cochrane Review Groups), including a summary of the review and a critical appraisal of its overall quality</li><li>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) - contains details of articles of Controlled trials</li><li>The Cochrane Methodology Register (CMR) is a bibliography of publications that report on methods used in the conduct of controlled trials</li><li>The Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database brings together details of completed and ongoing health technology assessments (studies of the medical, social, ethical, and economic implications of healthcare interventions) from around the world</li><li>NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) - identifies economic evaluations from around the world and appraises their quality</li></ul><br/>PsychINFO:<br/><br/>PsycINFO is a database of abstracts of literature in the field of psychology. It is produced by the American Psychological Association.<br/><br/>CINAHL:<br/><br/>CINAHL is the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. It contains  references to journal articles from hundreds of nursing journals from the UK, USA and other countries.<br/><br/>OpenGrey:<br/><br/>Formally called SIGLE (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe), OpenGrey is a database dedicated to grey literature. Grey literature are materials and research produced by organizations outside of the traditional commercial or academic publishing and distribution channels. Organizations that produce grey literature include government departments and agencies, civil society or non-governmental organisations, academic centres and departments, and private companies and consultants.<br/><br/>Ovid: <br/><br/>Although not in itself a database it is important to have an understanding of Ovid.<br/><br/>Ovid (named after the Roman poet) is an interface used to search multiple databases. It was originally used to access Medline results but diversified once PubMed came out (which is free). <br/><br/><b>Searching in PubMed</b><br/><br/>Boolean Logic:<br/><br/>Boolean logic refers to the logical relationships among search terms. The Boolean operators AND, OR, NOT can be used to combine search terms in PubMed. Boolean operators must be entered in uppercase letters.<br/><br/><ul><li>OR - Used to retrieve a set in which each citation contains at least one of the search terms</li><li>NOT - Retrieves a set from which citations to articles containing specified search terms following the NOT operator are eliminated</li><li>AND - Used to retrieve a set in which each citation contains all search terms (AND is the default operator used in PubMed. If you do not include Boolean operators in your search, PubMed will automatically use AND between terms.)</li></ul><br/>Boolean operators in PubMed, they are processed left to right.<br/><br/>Example: schizophrenia AND olanzapine OR quetiapine<br/><br/>This will retrieve records that include both terms schizophrenia AND olanzapine as well as all records with the term quetiapine, whether or not they contain the other two terms.<br/><br/>To change the order in which terms are processed, enclose the terms(s) in parentheses. The terms inside the set of parentheses will be processed as a unit and then incorporated into the overall strategy. This is called nesting.<br/><br/>Example: schizophrenia AND (olanzapine OR quetiapine)<br/><br/>Phrase Searching:<br/><br/>PubMed automatically searches for phrases during Automatic Term Mapping. A phrase search can be forced however using double quotes.<br/><br/>Example: frontal leucotomy<br/><br/>Truncation:<br/><br/>Truncation, or finding all terms that begin with a given string of text, is generally not a recommended search technique for PubMed.<br/><br/>The PubMed truncation symbol is the asterisk (*).<br/><br/>PubMed supports only end-truncation.<br/><br/>Example: neuro* (will return a number of terms such as neurology, neuroscience, neuron)<br/><br/>Medical Subject Headings (MeSH):<br/><br/>Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) are used by indexers to describe articles for MEDLINE records. The MeSH Database is like a thesaurus that enables you to explore this vocabulary.</div></div>
