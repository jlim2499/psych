<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Six men in a study on the sleep inducing effects of melatonin are aged 52, 55, 56, 58, 59, and 92.  What is the median age of the men included in the study?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">57</span></div><br/>The median is the point which has half the values above and half below. In the data set in the question there are an even number of values so the median value is half way between the two middle values (in bold below).<br/><br/>52, 55, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, 59, and 92<br/><br/>Therefore, <br/><br/>median = (56 + 58) / 2<br/>median = 57<br/></div>
