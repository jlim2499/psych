<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A consultant psychiatrist wants to know how their students rate their teaching sessions. <br/>Each student is asked to respond, on a scale of 1-5, how they rate the quality of the teaching sessions. A score of 1 indicates extremely unsatisfactory, 2 is unsatisfactory, 3 is neutral, 4 is satisfactory and 5 indicates extremely satisfactory.<br/><br/>How is this data best described?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Ordinal</span></div><br/>The data collected will be on an ordinal scale as there is a rank associated with each of the answer options, i.e. 2 is lower than 4 and 4 is lower than 5.<br/><br/>In an ordinal scale, it is not mandatory for the difference between 4 (satisfactory) and 2 (unsatisfactory) to be the same as the difference between 5 (extremely satisfactory) and 3 (neutral), as the number is not assigned for quantitative measurement but is purely for tagging purposes.<br/></div>
