<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A new scale for measuring obsessive-compulsive symptoms shows strong correlation with other OCD measures but minimal correlation with measures of general anxiety. This pattern suggests: <br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">High convergent validity and high discriminant validity</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>High convergent validity and high discriminant validity</b>. This pattern suggests that the scale measures obsessive-compulsive symptoms effectively. High convergent validity is demonstrated by the strong correlation with other OCD measures, indicating that the scale aligns well with established tools assessing the same construct. High discriminant validity is shown by the minimal correlation with measures of general anxiety, which supports the scale's ability to distinguish OCD symptoms from related but separate constructs.<br/><br/><b>Low reliability but high validity</b>: This is incorrect. Reliability (consistency of measurement) is typically required to achieve high validity. A scale with high validity would also need to be reliable.<br/><br/><b>High face validity but low construct validity</b>: This is incorrect. Face validity refers to how appropriate the scale appears to be for measuring OCD based on subjective judgment, but it does not necessarily indicate high construct validity. In this case, the scale demonstrates strong construct validity (via convergent and discriminant validity), not low construct validity.<br/><br/><b>High predictive validity but low content validity</b>: This is incorrect. Predictive validity refers to how well the scale predicts future outcomes related to OCD, which is not addressed here. Content validity assesses whether the scale covers all aspects of OCD, which is also not the focus of this question.<br/><br/><b>Low concurrent validity and high ecological validity</b>: This is incorrect. Concurrent validity refers to how well the scale correlates with other measures taken at the same time. Here, the scale demonstrates high concurrent validity (strong correlation with other OCD measures) and does not directly address ecological validity, which refers to how well the scale reflects real-world conditions.<br/></div>
