There are no intermediate values between discrete data points.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Correct Answer:<br/><br/>Discrete data is counted and cannot take on every possible value within the range that they are defined. For instance, the number of patients in a clinic is discrete because it is counted in whole numbers; there cannot be 3.5 patients.<br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Dichotomous: This is not the correct answer because dichotomous data is a type of categorical data that only takes on two possible values. While it is a specific type of discrete data, the description does not limit the data to only two outcomes, thus it is too specific.<br/><br/>Nominal: Nominal data is a type of categorical data that represents discrete categories without any inherent order. The description does not imply that the data is categorical or without order, only that it is not continuous.<br/><br/>Ratio variable: Ratio variables are continuous and have a true zero point. Since the description states that no intermediate values are possible, ratio variables do not fit, as they allow for fractions and decimals.<br/><br/>Interval variable: Interval variables are similar to ratio variables but do not have a true zero point. They are continuous and can take on an infinite number of values within a range, which is not consistent with the description.<br/><br/>Ordinal: Ordinal data is categorical and has an inherent order, but the description does not imply an order, only that the values are discrete.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>373.</b></td><td>A measurement where the difference between two values is meaningful but there is no absolute zero</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Interval variable</b> Explanation for the Correct Answer:<br/><br/>Interval variable: This is the correct answer. Interval data is characterized by measurements where the differences between values are meaningful. The classic example is temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit; the difference between 10Â°C and 20Â°C is the same as between 20Â°C and 30Â°C. However, there is no true zero point that indicates the absence of temperature, as zero degrees Celsius does not mean 'no temperature'.<br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Dichotomous: This type of data consists of only two possible values and does not involve the concept of measurement scales or the absence of an absolute zero.<br/><br/>Discrete: Discrete data refers to countable values, not to the scale or differences between measurements. It does not provide information on the meaningfulness of the difference between any two values.<br/><br/>Nominal: Nominal data is categorical, with no implied order or scale, and differences between data points are not quantifiable.<br/><br/>Ratio variable: Ratio data have both meaningful differences between data points and a true zero point, which indicates none of the quantity is present. For example, weight is a ratio variable, as 0 kg means there is no weight.<br/><br/>Ordinal: Ordinal data represents categories with a meaningful order, but the differences between those categories are not necessarily equal or meaningful. It also does not involve the absence of an absolute zero.<br/><br/>Understanding the characteristics of interval data is essential, particularly in the medical field, where temperature and blood pressure are common interval measurements that do not have a true zero point. These measures are critical in clinical assessments and research.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>374.</b></td><td>A survey instrument in which respondents are asked to rate the satisfaction with a service with one of the following:<br/><br/>Unsatisfied<br/>Satisfied<br/>Very satisfied<br/>Extremely satisfied </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Ordinal</b> Explanation for the Correct Answer:<br/><br/>Ordinal variable: This is the correct answer. Ordinal data is data that represents categories with a natural order, but the intervals between the categories are not necessarily equal or quantifiable. In the given example, the order of satisfaction (unsatisfied, satisfied, very satisfied, extremely satisfied) is clear, but the difference in satisfaction between each category is not numerically defined.<br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Dichotomous: This type of data involves only two possible values. The example given has more than two possible responses, so it is not dichotomous.<br/><br/>Discrete: Discrete data refers to countable values. While the responses can be counted, the key feature of this survey is the ordered nature of the responses, making 'ordinal' a more accurate description.<br/><br/>Nominal: Nominal data consists of discrete categories without any inherent order. In the given example, there is a clear order of satisfaction, so 'nominal' does not apply.<br/><br/>Ratio variable: Ratio data have meaningful zero points and equal intervals. The survey does not imply a true zero point nor equal intervals between satisfaction levels.<br/><br/>Interval variable: Interval data have equal intervals between values, but no true zero point. Although 'interval variable' is closer than some of the other incorrect options, it still does not fit because the intervals between levels of satisfaction are not defined.<br/><br/>Understanding ordinal data is important for analysing survey results, especially in medical research and patient satisfaction surveys, where it is common to categorize subjective responses such as pain, satisfaction, and quality of life.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/></div>
