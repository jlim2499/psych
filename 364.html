<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Regarding confounding, which of the following is true?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">A confounding factor distorts the relationship between an exposure and an outcome</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>A confounding factor distorts the relationship between an exposure and an outcome</b>. This is the fundamental definition of confounding. A confounding variable is associated with both the exposure and the outcome, creating a spurious association or masking a true one. For example, in a study investigating the link between smoking and lung cancer, age could act as a confounder if not properly controlled, as it is associated with both smoking behaviour and cancer risk.<br/><br/><b>Randomisation can control confounding in the analytic stage of a study</b> is incorrect. Randomisation is a tool utilised during the design phase of a study, not during the analytic phase. By randomly allocating participants, it balances confounding variables between groups, reducing bias before the analysis begins. In practice, confounding in the analytic stage is typically addressed using techniques such as multivariable regression or stratification.<br/><br/><b>Stratification is not used to control for confounding</b> is incorrect. Stratification is a key method to control for confounding by analysing subgroups of the population where the confounding variable is constant. For instance, in a study evaluating the impact of a new antidepressant, stratifying results by age groups ensures that age-related confounding is minimised.<br/><br/><b>Instrumental variables are not useful for controlling confounding</b> is incorrect. Instrumental variables are a specialised method used to control for confounding in observational studies. They are particularly helpful when randomisation is not feasible, by relying on a variable that is associated with the exposure but not directly with the outcome, except through the exposure.<br/><br/><b>Age and sex are always confounders in studies</b> is incorrect. While age and sex are common confounders, they are not always confounders. A variable is only considered a confounder if it is associated with both the exposure and the outcome, and it is not on the causal pathway. For example, in a study examining the relationship between a drug and recovery rates, age is a confounder only if it influences both drug uptake and recovery independently.<br/></div>
