The test was positive in 40 of the 50 patients shown to have early Alzheimer's by standard clinical assessment. It was also positive in 20 patients who were shown not to have early Alzheimer's. What is the positive predictive value of the test?<br/><br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">0.66</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>0.66</b>. Positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that subjects with a positive screening test truly have the disease. It is calculated as the number of true positives (those who have the disease and test positive) divided by the total number of positive tests results, both true and false. In this scenario, there were 40 true positives (patients with early Alzheimer's who tested positive) and 20 false positives (patients without Alzheimer's who tested positive), giving a PPV of 40 / (40 + 20) = 0.66.<br/><br/>The option <b>0.8</b> might be chosen if one mistakenly calculates sensitivity instead of PPV. Sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease, calculated as true positives / (true positives + false negatives). Here, there are no false negatives mentioned so it cannot be calculated.<br/><br/>The option <b>0.33</b> may result from incorrect calculations or misunderstanding of what constitutes a 'positive' outcome in this context.<br/><br/>Choosing <b>0.1</b> would suggest a significant error in calculation or interpretation of PPV - perhaps confusing it with specificity or negative predictive value.<br/><br/>Lastly, stating that the PPV <b>cannot be calculated</b> would be incorrect because we have all necessary values: true positives and total positives (true positives plus false positives). This option might be selected if one confuses PPV with other statistical measures which require more information such as sensitivity or specificity, for which not all necessary values are given here.<br/><br/></div>
