<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>The following is a description of a study conducted on anorexia nervosa. After reading the description of the study, select the option that best fits the study design.<br/>Background: Caring for someone with anorexia nervosa is distressing.<br/><br/>Aims: To gain a detailed understanding of carers illness models and caregiving experiences<br/><br/>Method: Letters from 20 fathers and 20 mothers were collected and included in the analysis. For 13 patients, both parents letters were included; for the other 14 patients only one parents letter was available.  Letters were analysed using the constant comparative method of the grounded theory approach.<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Qualitative</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Qualitative</b>. A qualitative study design is used when the aim of a study is to gain an in-depth understanding of a specific phenomenon or experience, often from the perspective of those experiencing it. In this case, the researchers are seeking to understand carers' illness models and caregiving experiences. The method used, grounded theory approach with constant comparative method, is a common methodology in qualitative research. It involves collecting data (in this case letters), coding it into categories and themes, and then developing these into theories.<br/><br/><b>Observational</b> studies are incorrect as they involve observing subjects without any intervention from the researcher. They can be either descriptive (reporting what is happening) or analytical (investigating why it is happening). In this question, there's no mention of observation being made by the researchers.<br/><br/><b>Case series</b> studies are also incorrect as they involve detailed reports on several patients who have a similar condition or have undergone a similar treatment. Here, there's no detailed report on multiple patients but instead an analysis of letters written by parents caring for individuals with anorexia nervosa.<br/><br/><b>Experimental</b> studies are not correct because they involve interventions made by researchers to determine cause-and-effect relationships. There's no intervention mentioned in this question; rather, existing data (letters) were analysed.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Analytic</b> studies would be incorrect as well because these types of studies compare groups to identify associations or causes. This study does not compare different groups nor seeks to establish cause and effect relationships but aims at gaining understanding about caregiversâ€™ experiences and perspectives.<br/><br/></div>
