The number needed to treat (NNT) refers to the number of patients that need to be treated for one to benefit compared with a control in a clinical trial. It is calculated as the inverse of the absolute risk reduction (ARR). ARR is the difference in risk between control group and treatment group, or the decrease in risk of a treatment compared to a control. Therefore, 1 / (Absolute risk reduction) correctly represents the formula for NNT.<br/><br/>The option <b>(Absolute Risk Reduction) / (Number of people in trial)</b> is incorrect because it incorrectly places the number of people in trial as a denominator with ARR. In actuality, ARR itself is derived from comparing event rates across different numbers of people in both treatment and control groups, so this division would not yield an accurate NNT.<br/><br/><b>((Control event rate) - (Experimental event rate)) / (Control event rate)</b> does indeed calculate the Absolute Risk Reduction but dividing by Control event rate again would not provide an accurate NNT. This equation essentially calculates relative risk reduction rather than absolute risk reduction.<br/><br/><b>1 / (Relative risk)</b> would not yield an accurate NNT because relative risk is a ratio that compares the probability of an event occurring in exposed group versus non-exposed group. It does not provide information about absolute difference between two probabilities which is required for calculating NNT.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>1 / (Hazard ratio)</b> also doesn't correctly calculate NNT. A hazard ratio compares the hazard rates, or risks over time, in two groups. It's often used in survival analysis and does not provide direct information about absolute differences between probabilities necessary for calculating NNT.<br/><br/></div>
