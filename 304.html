The average height of the adults is 169cm, with a standard deviation of 16cm. What is the standard error of the mean?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">1.6</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Standard error of the mean = standard deviation / square root (number of patients)</div>The correct answer is <b>1.6</b>. The standard error of the mean (SEM) is a measure of how far the sample mean of data is likely to be from the true population mean. It can be calculated using the formula SEM = SD/√n, where SD is the standard deviation and n is the number of observations. Here, the standard deviation (SD) is 16cm and there are 100 observations (n), hence SEM = 16/√100 = 16/10 = 1.6.<br/><br/>Let's discuss why other options are incorrect:<br/><br/><b>1.69</b>: This option seems to have been calculated by simply dividing the average height by the number of observations (169/100). However, this doesn't make sense in this context as it does not incorporate any information about variability in height measurements (i.e., standard deviation). <br/><br/><b>0.16</b>: This result would have been obtained if one had divided the standard deviation by the number of observations rather than by square root of number of observations - which would be an incorrect approach to calculate SEM.<br/><br/><b>1.3</b>: It's unclear how this value could have been calculated based on given data, but it's not consistent with proper calculation for SEM.<br/><br/><b>Cannot be calculated</b>: The necessary information to calculate SEM has indeed been provided: both a standard deviation and a sample size are available from given data. Therefore, it can definitely be calculated.<br/><br/>In conclusion, understanding how to calculate and interpret Standard Error of Mean is crucial in medical research as it provides an estimate on how much our sample mean deviates from population mean and helps us understand precision with which we estimate population parameter.<br/><br/></div>
