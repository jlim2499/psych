<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>If a disease has a standard mortality ratio (SMR) of 1.4 in a sampled population, which of the following statements is true?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">There were 40% more fatalities from the disease in this population compared to the reference population</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>There were 40% more fatalities from the disease in this population compared to the reference population</b>. An SMR of 1.4 indicates that the observed mortality in the study population is 40% higher than what would be expected based on the mortality rates of a reference population.<br/><br/><b>The disease caused 140 deaths in the sample population during the study period</b> is incorrect. The SMR does not provide the absolute number of deaths; it provides a ratio of observed to expected deaths.<br/><br/><b>Mortality from the disease in the sampled population is lower than would be expected</b> is incorrect. An SMR of 1.4 indicates higher, not lower, mortality than expected.<br/><br/><b>Mortality from the disease in the sampled population is as would be expected</b> is incorrect. An SMR of 1.4 means that mortality is higher than expected, not the same.<br/><br/><b>There were 140% more fatalities from the disease in this population compared to the reference population</b> is incorrect. An SMR of 1.4 means there were 40% more fatalities, not 140%.<br/></div>
