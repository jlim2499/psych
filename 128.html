<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>What is the correct formula to calculate the positive predictive value?<br/>TP = true positive; FP = false positive; TN = true negative; FN = false negative<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">TP / (TP + FP)</span></div><br/>The correct formula to calculate the positive predictive value is <b>TP / (TP + FP)</b>. Positive predictive value (PPV), also known as precision, measures the proportion of actual positive cases among those predicted as positive. It is calculated by dividing the true positives (TP) by the sum of true positives and false positives (FP). This means that PPV represents how likely it is that a positive test result actually indicates a true positive.<br/><br/>The first option, <b>Sensitivity / (1 - specificity)</b>, is incorrect because this formula calculates the likelihood ratio for a positive test result, not the PPV. Sensitivity refers to the ability of a test to correctly identify those with a disease (true positive rate), while specificity refers to the ability of a test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negative rate).<br/><br/>The third option, <b>TN / (TN + FP)</b>, is also incorrect. This formula calculates specificity, which measures the proportion of negatives that are correctly identified as such. In other words, if you have a disease-free individual, it tells you how likely the test is to be negative.<br/><br/>The fourth option, <b>TN / (TN + FN)</b>, does not represent any recognised statistical measure in diagnostic testing and hence is incorrect. It would theoretically represent the proportion of negative results that are truly disease-free but this isn't a standard measure used in medical statistics.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>TP / (TP + FN )</b> is incorrect because this formula calculates sensitivity rather than PPV. Sensitivity measures how well a test identifies true positives from all individuals with the disease. Therefore, it's calculated by dividing TP by the sum of TP and FN.<br/></div>
