<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is a measure of dispersion?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Standard deviation</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Standard deviation</b>. Standard deviation is a measure of dispersion that shows how much individual data points differ from the mean of a dataset. In clinical practice, understanding variability, such as in patient responses to treatment, is crucial. For example, in psychiatry, knowing the standard deviation of scores on a depression scale can help assess the consistency of patients' responses over time.<br/><br/><b>Mean</b>: The mean, or average, is a measure of central tendency, not dispersion. It represents the typical value in a dataset rather than the spread of data points. Clinically, while the mean can summarise patient scores, it does not indicate the variability or diversity of responses.<br/><br/><b>Median</b>: The median is another measure of central tendency that identifies the midpoint in a dataset when ordered from lowest to highest. It is useful for understanding the central point but does not provide information about the data's spread. For example, knowing the median age of patients may help in demographic analysis but doesn't reveal age variability.<br/><br/><b>Mode</b>: The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. Like the mean and median, it is a measure of central tendency. In psychiatry, while the mode might highlight common responses, it does not convey information about the dispersion of responses around a central value.<br/><br/><b>Proportion</b>: Proportion indicates the relative frequency of a particular outcome in a dataset but is not a measure of dispersion. For instance, knowing the proportion of patients showing improvement can be informative, but it doesn't indicate how variable those improvements are across the patient group.<br/></div>
