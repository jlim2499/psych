<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A study on depression is criticised for producing results that do not generalise to typical patient populations.  This test can be said to have poor:<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">External validity</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Good external validity means that a results of a study generalise well to other populations.</div>The correct answer is <b>External validity</b>. External validity refers to the ability of a study's results to be generalised to other settings or groups. In this case, if the study on depression has produced results that do not generalise well to typical patient populations, it suggests that the study lacks external validity. This could be due to factors such as a non-representative sample size, uncontrolled variables, or flawed research design.<br/><br/><b>Predictive validity</b> is incorrect because it refers specifically to how well a test predicts future behaviour or outcomes. For example, a depression screening tool would have high predictive validity if it accurately predicted who would develop depression in the future. However, this concept does not address the issue of generalisability to different populations.<br/><br/><b>Construct validity</b> is also incorrect as it pertains to whether a test measures what it claims to measure. If there were issues with construct validity in this study on depression, it might mean that the test used did not accurately measure depressive symptoms or severity. However, this doesn't directly relate to the criticism mentioned in the question about poor generalisation across patient populations.<br/><br/><b>Divergent validity</b>, another incorrect option, refers to how much two measures that are supposed to be unrelated actually are unrelated. If a study had poor divergent validity, this would mean that two constructs that should not be related are showing correlation; for instance, if a depression scale also inadvertently measured anxiety levels. <br/><br/>Lastly, <b>Face validity</b> is incorrect as it simply refers to whether a test appears (on its face) to measure what it's supposed to measure - in layman's terms; does the test look like it tests what it says it tests? Face validity does not delve into whether results can be generalised across different populations.<br/><br/>In summary, while all these forms of validity are important considerations when designing and evaluating a study, the criticism mentioned in the question is most directly related to external validity.<br/></div>
