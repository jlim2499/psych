There are three types of association:<br/><br/><ul><li>Spurious – A spurious association occurs when the relationship between two variables appears to exist, but it is false or misleading due to the influence of a confounding variable or random chance. In this case, there is no true relationship between the two variables. The confounding factor creates an illusion of a link, but the association is not real. For example, the apparent relationship between ice cream sales and drowning deaths is spurious, as the real factor influencing both is hot weather, not a direct or indirect link between the two variables.</li></ul><br/><ul><li>Indirect – An indirect association occurs when two variables are genuinely related, but the relationship is mediated or explained by a third variable (a confounder). In this case, the association is real, but the relationship is not direct. For example, socioeconomic status might be linked to health outcomes, but the true mechanism might be mediated through access to healthcare or lifestyle factors, making the relationship indirect. Unlike spurious associations, an indirect association reflects a real connection between the variables, just mediated by the confounder.</li></ul><br/><ul><li>Direct – A direct association exists when one variable directly affects another without the involvement of any confounding variable. This means that the relationship is causal in nature, where changes in one variable directly bring about changes in the other. For example, smoking directly causes lung cancer without the need for any intermediary factor.</li></ul><br/><b>Causation:</b><br/><br/>Once an association has been established, the next step is to determine whether the association is causal. Not all associations imply causality, so additional evidence is required to confirm a cause-and-effect relationship. Two widely used frameworks in causation analysis are Susser’s Criteria and the Bradford Hill Causal Criteria. These frameworks complement each other and provide a structured approach to assess causality.<br/><br/>Susser’s Criteria: Time Order, Association, and Direction (TAD)<br/><br/>Susser’s criteria ensure that a basic causal framework exists before moving to more in-depth evaluation. These foundational principles include:<br/><br/><ul><li>Time Order: The cause must precede the effect in time. Without this temporal relationship, causality cannot be established. For example, smoking must occur before lung cancer develops.</li></ul><br/><ul><li>Association: The two variables must be found together more often than would be expected by chance. For example, individuals who smoke are more likely to develop lung cancer compared to non-smokers.</li></ul><br/><ul><li>Direction: The relationship between the variables must follow a logical or plausible pathway. For instance, it is biologically plausible that smoking introduces carcinogens to the lungs, which can directly lead to cancer, establishing a one-way causal relationship.</li></ul><br/>Susser’s criteria serve as a foundation, ensuring that an association is meaningful and directional before applying more detailed causal analysis.<br/><br/>Bradford Hill Causal Criteria:<br/><br/>Building on the association identified by Susser’s criteria, the Bradford Hill framework provides further tools to assess whether the association is causal. The criteria include:<br/><br/><ul><li>Strength: A strong association increases the likelihood of causality. For example, the high relative risk of lung cancer in smokers compared to non-smokers (e.g., RR &gt; 20) supports causality. A RR of at least 2 is often suggested as the minimum needed for suspicion of causality. </li></ul><br/><ul><li>Temporality: The cause must always precede the effect. This aligns with Susser’s Time Order and is a fundamental requirement for causation.</li></ul><br/><ul><li>Specificity: An association is more likely to be causal if the cause leads to a specific outcome. While this is useful, it has limitations as many causes, like smoking, can lead to multiple outcomes (e.g., lung cancer, heart disease, and COPD).</li></ul><br/><ul><li>Coherence: The association must align with existing biological and epidemiological knowledge. For instance, the carcinogenic effects of tobacco on lung tissue are well-documented, supporting the coherence of the smoking-lung cancer relationship.</li></ul><br/><ul><li>Consistency: If the association is observed across multiple studies, populations, and contexts, it strengthens the case for causation. For example, the consistent relationship between asbestos exposure and mesothelioma across various studies supports a causal link.</li></ul><br/>How Susser’s and Bradford Hill’s Criteria Work Together<br/><br/>Time Order and Temporality:<br/><br/>Susser’s Time Order and Bradford Hill’s Temporality both emphasise that causality requires the cause to precede the effect. This is a non-negotiable aspect of causation.<br/><br/>Association and Strength:<br/><br/>Susser’s Association establishes the presence of a link, while Bradford Hill’s Strength evaluates the magnitude of this link (e.g., higher relative risks make causation more likely).<br/><br/>Direction and Coherence:<br/><br/>Susser’s Direction ensures the association follows a logical pathway. Bradford Hill’s Coherence builds on this by confirming that the relationship aligns with established scientific knowledge.<br/><br/>Practical Example: Smoking and Lung Cancer<br/><br/>Using Susser’s Criteria:<br/><br/>Time Order: Smoking occurs before the development of lung cancer.<br/>Association: Smoking is significantly more common among individuals with lung cancer than in non-smokers.<br/>Direction: The causal pathway is biologically plausible, as carcinogens in cigarette smoke can directly damage lung tissue.<br/><br/>Using Bradford Hill’s Criteria:<br/><br/>Strength: The strong relative risk of lung cancer in smokers supports causation.<br/>Temporality: Longitudinal studies show that smoking precedes lung cancer.<br/>Consistency: The link between smoking and lung cancer has been observed across numerous populations and studies.<br/>Coherence: Biological research confirms the role of cigarette carcinogens in inducing genetic mutations in lung cells.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/><i>Bradford Hill (1965) The Environment and Disease: Association or Causation?
