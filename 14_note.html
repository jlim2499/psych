Depending on the version used there are either 17 or 21 items.  Each item is scored out of between 3 and 5 points.  The greater the total points scored the more severe the depression is.  For the 17-item version (the most commonly used) scores range between 0 and 54.  Scores over 24 indicate a severe depression.<br/><br/>EPDS (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale: Specifically designed to address postnatal depression, but has also been validated in antepartum populations to detect depression during pregnancy. A ten-item self-report questionnaire. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale, giving a maximum score of 30. Respondents are asked to consider how they have felt in the past 7 days. A score of 10 or more is commonly used as an indicator of possible depression, but lower threshold scores (like 9 or even 7) might be used depending on the clinical setting and the population being screened. A score of 13 or above might indicate more severe depression.<br/><br/>HAMA (Hamilton anxiety rating scale): HAMA is a 14-item scale designed to measure the severity of anxiety.<br/> <br/>MADRS (Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale): The MADRS is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire used to measure the severity of depressive episodes.  It was designed to be more sensitive to the changes brought on by antidepressants and other forms of treatment.<br/><br/>ZSRDS (Zung self-rated depression scale): The ZSRDS was devised to assess the severity of depression.  There are 20 items on the scale, each one scored out of 1-4.<br/><br/>BDI (Beck depression inventory): The BDI is another scale designed to assess the severity of depression.  There are a total of 21 items, each is score out of 0-3.  The scale was revised in 1966. 0-13 indicates minimal depression, 14-19 mild depression, 20-28 moderate, and 29-63 severe depression.<br/><br/>GDS (geriatric depression scale): The GDS is a 30 item self-report scale used to screen for depression in the elderly.  Each question has either a yes or no response make the total score out of 30.  0-9 is deemed normal, 10-19 is mild depression, and 20-30 is severe depression.<br/><br/>BASDEC (Brief Assessment Schedule Depression Cards): The BASDEC is a screening test for depression. It uses a deck of cards with statements such as 'I've lost interest in things' which are shown to the patient. In response to each card, the patient indicates whether the card is true or false by pointing to another card. There are 19 cards with a maximum score of 21 (two cards carry 2 points each). It is a quick test and takes less than 5 minutes to administer. A cut off score of 7 is generally used. The test was developed for use on busy wards to introduce a degree of privacy as other tests involve questions being read out and someone in the next cubicle hearing everything.<br/><br/>CSDD (Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia): This test was developed specifically to screen for depression in dementia cases. It involves a 20 min interview with a carer and 10 mins with the patient. A total of 19 items are rated as either 'absent', 'mild / intermittent', or 'severe'.<br/><br/>PHQ-9 (9-question Patient Health Questionnaire): Asks patients 'over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems?' Total 9 items which can then be scored 0-3. Includes items asking about thoughts of self-harm. Depression severity = 0-4 none, 5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, 20-27 severe (this is the traditional scoring, note that NICE adopted a slightly different approach, see below)<br/><br/>NICE (ng222) grade depression into 'less severe and 'more severe'.<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid2"><thead><tr><th>Severity</th><th>PHQ-9</th><th>Comment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Less severe</td><td>&lt; 16</td><td>Subthreshold and mild depression</td></tr><tr><td>More severe</td><td>&gt; 16</td><td>Moderate and severe depression</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/><b>Bipolar</b><br/>YMRS (Young mania rating scale): The YMRS is an 11-item instrument used to assess the severity of mania in patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.<br/><br/><b>Schizophrenia</b><br/>BPRS (Brief psychiatric rating scale): Common instrument used to evaluate psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. Initially consisted of 16 items and the addition of two items created the standard 18. The expanded 24 item version (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-Expanded) was introduced later to measure additional aspects of schizophrenia by adding items for bizarre behaviour, self-neglect, suicidality, elevated mood, motor hyperactivity and distractibility.<br/><br/>PANSS (Positive and negative syndrome scale): The PANSS looks at both positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia.  It takes a wide sample of information, including data from and interview, along with reports from hospital staff and family.  The information gathered is based on how the patient was in the previous week.  It has 30 items.<br/><br/><b>OCD</b><br/>Y-BOCS (Yale-Brown Obsessive compulsive scale): The Y-BOCS is used to measure both the severity of OCD and the response to treatment.<br/><br/><b>Medication</b><br/>DESS (Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms scale): The DESS is used to quantify discontinuation symptoms associated with stopping antidepressants. This 43-item rating scale spans a broad spectrum of discontinuation symptoms and can be helpful in documenting symptoms of depressed patients in order to diagnose the likely cause of distress.<br/><br/>SAS (Simpson-Angus Scale): Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) is a 10-item rating scale that has been used widely for assessment of neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism. It consists of one item measuring gait (hypokinesia), six items measuring rigidity and three items measuring glabella tap, tremor and salivation, respectively.<br/><br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><a class="fancybox" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb130b.png" rel="group"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb130.png"/></a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"><a class="fancybox lbmagglasslink" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb130b.png" rel="group"><img src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/>Each item is rated on a 5-point scale of severity (0 = normal; 4 = most severe). A total score of 0-40 is calculated (or scale score can be calculated by dividing the total by 10 to give a score between 0 and 4), with a raw score of &lt; 3 identifying 'normal' symptoms, ≥ 6 indicating a level of disorder for which treatment should be reconsidered, ≥ 12 requiring attention, and a score of ≥ 18 'almost certainly' requiring modification of pharmacotherapy.<br/><br/>LUNSERS (The Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effect Rating Scale): Self-rated scale for measuring the side-effect of antipsychotic medications. The scale consists of 41 known side effects of neuroleptics. Each 'side-effect' listed is scored on a five point rating scale of 0 - 4, i.e. 0 = 'Not at all' and 4 = Very much. It can be used to provide a general overview of the person's experience to side effects over the last month. It is useful also in pinpointing specific troublesome side effects for further assessment and / or changes in the medication strategy. In addition, 10 'red herring' items were included, referring to symptoms that are not known neuroleptic side-effects (e.g. chilblains, hair loss), to help validate the results.<br/><br/>Scoring is as follows:<br/><br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><a class="fancybox" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb132b.png" rel="group"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb132.png"/></a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"><a class="fancybox lbmagglasslink" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb132b.png" rel="group"><img src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/>AIMS (The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale): The AIMS is a 12-item clinician-rated scale to assess severity of dyskinesias (specifically, orofacial movements and extremity and truncal movements) in patients taking neuroleptic medications. Additional items assess the overall severity, incapacitation, and the patient's level of awareness of the movements, and distress associated with them. The AIMS has been used extensively to assess tardive dyskinesia in clinical trials of antipsychotic medications. Due to its simple design and short assessment time, the AIMS can easily be integrated into a routine clinical evaluation by the clinician or another trained rater.<br/><br/>Items are scored on a 0 (none) to 4 (severe) basis; the scale provides a total score (items 1 through 7), or item 8 can be used in isolation as an indication of overall severity of symptoms. A rating of 2 or higher on the AIMS scale, is evidence of tardive dyskinesia. If the patient has mild TD in two areas or moderate movements in one area, then he or she should be given a diagnosis of TD. <br/><br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><a class="fancybox" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb134b.png" rel="group"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb134.png"/></a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"><a class="fancybox lbmagglasslink" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb134b.png" rel="group"><img src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/><b>Global</b><br/>GAF (Global assessment of functioning): The GAF provides a single measure of global functioning.  It enquires about psychological and occupational functioning only.  The total score is out of 100.  A score of 100 is the best that can be achieved and indicates that a patient functions at the highest level possible.<br/><br/>CGI (Clinical global impression): The CGI is a scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis.<br/><br/>GHQ (General Health Questionnaire): A self-administered screening questionnaire designed to identify short-term changes in mental health (specifically, minor psychiatric disorders). Comes in various versions, with the GHQ-12 being the most widely used.<br/><br/><b>Dementia</b><br/>CAMDEX (Cambridge Mental Disorders of the Elderly Examination): Developed to assist in the early diagnosis and measurement of dementia in the elderly. Includes three components: clinical interview, set of cognitive tests, and interview with patient's relative to obtain independent information on the patient's past and present state.<br/><br/><b>Personality</b><br/>Standardised Assessment of Personality Abbreviated Scale (SAPAS): Is an interview method that focuses on eight areas of personality. It takes approximately two minutes to complete and is scored between 0 and 8. The SAPAS consists of yes/no answers to eight statements, and a score of three or more warrants further assessment.<br/><br/>Five Factor Model Rating Form (FFMRF): Is a self-reported tool consisting of 30 items, each rated on a scale of 1 to 5. This form is based on symptoms rather than diagnoses and assesses personality traits according to the five-factor model.<br/><br/>International Personality Disorder Examination Screen (IPDE): Can be administered both as an interview method and as a self-reported tool. It is a semi-structured clinical interview compatible with both the ICD and DSM. The IPDE includes a patient questionnaire and an interview component.<br/><br/>Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-Revised (PDQ-R): Is a self-reported tool that consists of 100 true/false questions. It takes about 30 minutes to complete and is based on DSM-IV criteria for personality disorders.<br/><br/>Iowa Personality Disorder Screen (IPDS): Is another interview method tool. It consists of 11 criteria and can be completed in less than five minutes, making it a quick screening option.<br/><br/>IIP Personality Disorder Scales (IIP-PD): Is a self-reported tool containing 127 items. Each item is rated on a scale of 0 to 4, providing a comprehensive assessment of personality disorder symptoms.</div></div>
