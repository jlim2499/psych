<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Regarding histograms, which of the following is true?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">The quantity on the vertical axis is the frequency density</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>The quantity on the vertical axis is the frequency density</b>. In a histogram, the vertical axis represents the frequency density, not just the raw frequency. Frequency density can be calculated by dividing the frequency of each class interval by its respective width. This allows for comparisons between different groups that may have varying class widths.<br/><br/><b>The horizontal axis does not have a scale</b> is incorrect because histograms always have scales on both axes. The horizontal or x-axis typically represents the intervals or 'classes' of data and it must be scaled appropriately to accurately reflect these classes.<br/><br/><b>They are best used for categorical data</b> is also incorrect. Histograms are actually best used for continuous numerical data rather than categorical data. For categorical data, bar charts or pie charts are more appropriate as they show counts of distinct categories rather than distributions of continuous measurements.<br/><br/>The statement <b>The height of the bar indicates the frequency</b> is inaccurate in relation to histograms. Although this might be true for bar charts, in a histogram, it's not necessarily true because heights of bars represent frequency densities rather than raw frequencies, especially when class intervals vary in size.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>Columns must have the same width</b> isn't always true in case of histograms. While it's often easier to interpret histograms where all columns (or bars) are of equal width (representing equal class intervals), it's possible to construct histograms with varying column widths if class intervals themselves vary in size. However, in such cases, we need to adjust frequencies by converting them into frequency densities to allow fair comparison across different sized class intervals.<br/><br/></div>
