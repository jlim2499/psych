<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A psychiatrist administers a standardised anxiety questionnaire to a patient at the start of treatment and then again two weeks later to assess treatment response. Which form of reliability is most applicable in evaluating the consistency of the results over these two time points?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Test-retest reliability</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Test-retest reliability</b>. Test-retest reliability assesses the stability of a test over time by administering the same test to the same individual on two different occasions. In this scenario, the psychiatrist administers an anxiety questionnaire at the start of treatment and again two weeks later to determine if the scores are consistent over time. High test-retest reliability would indicate that the measure is stable and yields similar results if the patient's anxiety levels remain unchanged.<br/><br/><b>Split-half reliability</b>: Split-half reliability evaluates the internal consistency of a test by dividing it into two halves (e.g., odd and even items) and comparing the results. This approach assesses item consistency within a single administration rather than consistency over time, making it unsuitable here.<br/><br/><b>Parallel-forms reliability</b>: Parallel-forms reliability involves administering two equivalent forms of a test and comparing the results. This type of reliability is useful for avoiding practice effects but does not apply here, as the question is concerned with using the same form over two different time points.<br/><br/><b>Internal consistency reliability</b>: Internal consistency reliability measures how consistently items within a single test measure the same construct, often assessed with Cronbachâ€™s alpha. It does not evaluate the consistency of scores across different time points, which is the focus here.<br/><br/><b>Inter-rater reliability</b>: Inter-rater reliability assesses the consistency of scores between different raters or observers. This type of reliability is relevant when multiple raters are involved in assessment but does not apply here, as the same rater administers the test at two time points.<br/></div>
