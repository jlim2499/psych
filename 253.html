Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) makes use of the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), which compares the difference in costs and effectiveness between two or more interventions. The ICER is particularly important in helping clinicians and policymakers make informed decisions about which interventions provide the best value for money in terms of health outcomes.<br/><br/><b>Cost-benefit analysis</b>: This method does not typically use ICER. Instead, it measures both costs and benefits in monetary terms to determine the net benefit of an intervention. While it is useful for comparing the economic value of different interventions, it does not provide a cost-effectiveness ratio in terms of health outcomes, which is what ICER does.<br/><br/><b>Cost-minimisation analysis</b>: This analysis is used when the outcomes of different interventions are the same, and only the costs are compared. Since the outcomes are assumed to be identical, there is no need to calculate an ICER, making this method unsuitable for its use.<br/><br/><b>Cost-consequences analysis</b>: This approach presents costs and outcomes in a disaggregated manner, without combining them into a single summary measure like ICER. While it provides useful information, it does not facilitate direct comparisons of cost-effectiveness between interventions, which is the purpose of ICER.<br/><br/><b>Cost-utility analysis</b>: Although similar to CEA, cost-utility analysis specifically uses the Incremental Cost-Utility Ratio (ICUR), which is a variant of ICER. It measures outcomes in terms of utility, such as Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), rather than natural units of effectiveness. Therefore, while ICUR is related to ICER, it is technically distinct.<br/></div>
