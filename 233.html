<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is a type of qualitative research that describes the culture of a group?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Ethnography</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Ethnography</b>. Ethnography is a type of qualitative research that seeks to understand and describe the culture or social phenomena from the perspective of the subject group. It involves fieldwork where researchers immerse themselves in the setting, observing and participating in daily activities which allows for a deep understanding of behaviours, beliefs, social interactions and experiences within that particular cultural context. <br/><br/>The option <b>Bracketing</b> is incorrect as it refers to a method used in qualitative research to mitigate the potential deleterious effects of preconceptions that may taint the research process. Bracketing involves identifying and holding in abeyance preconceived beliefs and opinions about the phenomenon under study.<br/><br/><b>Grounded Theory</b>, another incorrect option, is a research methodology that involves the collection and analysis of data with the aim of developing theories grounded in real-world observations. Unlike ethnography which aims to describe cultures, grounded theory seeks to explain phenomena by generating new theories.<br/><br/><b>Case Study</b>, also an incorrect choice, is a research design that investigates a phenomenon within its real-life context. It can be quantitative or qualitative, but it typically involves detailed, contextual analysis of only a single event or condition and its relationships.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>Phenomenology</b>, while a form of qualitative research, does not specifically focus on describing cultures. Instead, phenomenology aims at exploring how individuals perceive their experiences; it's more about understanding human behaviour from the individual's own subjective viewpoint.<br/><br/>Therefore, while all options are related to qualitative research methods, only ethnography specifically focuses on describing the culture of a group.<br/></div>
