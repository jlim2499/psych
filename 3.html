<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following scales used to assess attitudes generally uses a seven point scale and lists of bipolar options such as 'strong' or 'weak'?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Semantic Differential Scale</span></div><br/>The correct answer is the <b>Semantic Differential Scale</b>. This scale is a type of a rating scale designed to measure the connotative meaning of objects, events, and concepts. The connotations are used to derive the attitude towards the given object, event or concept. It uses bipolar adjectives (like 'strong' or 'weak') and typically operates on a seven-point scale, ranging from one extreme adjective to another.<br/><br/><b>Guttman Scale</b>, also known as cumulative scaling or scalogram analysis, is incorrect because this type of scale involves a series of items arranged in increasing order of intensity of the attitude. Each item implies the endorsement of all previous items. However, it does not use a seven point scale or lists of bipolar options.<br/><br/>The <b>Likert Scale</b> is incorrect because while it does measure attitudes, it typically uses a five (or sometimes seven) point scale that ranges from one extreme to another (e.g., 'strongly agree' to 'strongly disagree'). However, it doesn't use lists of bipolar adjectives like 'strong' or 'weak'.<br/><br/><b>Multi Dimensional Scaling</b> is also incorrect. This statistical technique is used in information visualization for exploring similarities or dissimilarities in data. It doesn't involve any kind of seven-point scale nor does it use lists of bipolar options.<br/><br/>Lastly, the <b>Thurstone Scale</b> is incorrect because this method involves statements that are each assigned a numerical value based on how favourable they are towards an attitude object. Respondents indicate whether they agree or disagree with each statement but it doesn't operate on a seven-point scale nor does it utilise bipolar adjective pairs.<br/><br/></div>
