<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which criterion aligns with both Susser’s framework and Bradford Hill’s criteria?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Temporality</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Temporality</b>. Both Susser’s framework and Bradford Hill’s criteria emphasise the importance of temporality in establishing causation. For a causal relationship to exist, the cause must precede the effect. Temporality is a fundamental and non-negotiable criterion in both frameworks.<br/><br/><b>Specificity</b>: Specificity is part of Bradford Hill’s criteria and suggests that a cause leading to a specific effect strengthens the case for causality. However, it is not explicitly addressed in Susser’s framework, as many causes have multiple effects.<br/><br/><b>Strength</b>: Strength, or the magnitude of the association, is included in Bradford Hill’s criteria but is not part of Susser’s framework, which focuses on identifying the presence of an association rather than its strength.<br/><br/><b>Coherence</b>: Coherence is specific to Bradford Hill’s criteria and evaluates whether the association aligns with existing biological and epidemiological knowledge. It is not a component of Susser’s framework.<br/><br/><b>Consistency</b>: Consistency is a Bradford Hill criterion that refers to observing the same association across multiple studies and populations. While it strengthens the case for causality, it is not a direct part of Susser’s criteria.<br/></div>
