<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>If the sample mean of a data set is 15 and the sample standard deviation is 9, what percent of the data would you expect to fall between 6 and 24, assuming that the data distribution is fairly symmetric?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">68.3 percent</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>68.3 percent</b>. This is because in a normal distribution, approximately 68.3% of the data falls within one standard deviation from the mean. In this case, the mean is 15 and the standard deviation is 9, so one standard deviation below the mean would be 6 (15-9) and one standard deviation above the mean would be 24 (15+9). Therefore, we would expect about 68.3% of the data to fall between these two values.<br/><br/><b>50.1 percent</b> is incorrect because it represents a value less than one standard deviation away from the mean in a normal distribution. The percentage of data falling within half of a standard deviation from the mean in a normal distribution is approximately 38.2%. Therefore, if we consider both sides of the mean (i.e., half a standard deviation below and half above), we get approximately 76.4%, which is still greater than 50.1%.<br/><br/><b>99.7 percent</b> refers to three standard deviations away from the mean on either side in a normal distribution - not one as in this case. If our range was from -12 to 42 (three standard deviations below and above the mean respectively), then this option would have been correct.<br/><br/><b>81.5 percent</b> does not correspond to any specific number of standard deviations around the mean in a normally distributed dataset.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>90 percent</b> corresponds roughly to an interval spanning 1.645 standard deviations on either side of the mean in a normal distribution - again not applicable here as our range spans only one standard deviation on either side of the mean.<br/><br/></div>
