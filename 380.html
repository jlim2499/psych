<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A researcher is asked to conduct an evaluation of olanzapine versus haloperidol to determine which one provides the best reduction in symptom severity of schizophrenia (as per the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) for each pound spent. Which of the following would be the most appropriate study method?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Cost-effectiveness analysis</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Cost-effectiveness analysis</b>. This method of study compares the costs and effects of two or more interventions, in this case olanzapine versus haloperidol, to determine which one provides the best reduction in symptom severity for each pound spent. The effectiveness is measured using a natural unit such as life-years gained or, as in this case, reduction in symptom severity according to the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Cost-effectiveness analysis allows for a clear comparison between different treatment options based on their cost per unit of effectiveness.<br/><br/><b>Cost-benefit analysis</b>, while it also compares costs and benefits of interventions, uses monetary units to measure both. In other words, it attempts to assign a monetary value to health outcomes (benefits), which can be difficult and controversial. It would not be the most appropriate method for this particular study because it's challenging to quantify health improvements like reduction in schizophrenia symptoms into monetary terms.<br/><br/><b>Cost-utility analysis</b> is similar to cost-effectiveness analysis but measures health outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). These metrics take into account both the quantity and quality of life lived. However, since the researcher is specifically interested in measuring symptom severity according to the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale rather than QALYs or DALYs, cost-utility analysis would not be suitable.<br/><br/>A <b>Cost of illness study</b> estimates the economic burden of a disease or condition including direct medical costs (e.g., hospitalisations), indirect non-medical costs (e.g., lost productivity), and intangible costs (e.g., pain and suffering). This type of study does not compare interventions nor does it provide information about cost-effectiveness.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>Cost-minimisation analysis</b> assumes that two or more interventions have the same effect and compares only their costs. Since the researcher is interested in comparing the effectiveness of two interventions, olanzapine and haloperidol, this method would not be appropriate.<br/></div>
