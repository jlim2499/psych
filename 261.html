<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following factors is most likely to adversely affect the Kappa statistic when assessing inter-rater reliability in psychiatric diagnoses?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Skewed prevalence of the diagnosed condition</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Skewed prevalence of the diagnosed condition</b>. When one category (e.g., 'diagnosed condition present') dominates the dataset, it inflates the expected agreement due to chance, leading to an artificially low Kappa statistic despite high observed agreement. This is particularly problematic in psychiatric settings, where some conditions (e.g., depression) are much more prevalent than others.<br/><br/><b>High percentage of overall agreement between raters</b>: A high percentage of agreement does not adversely affect the Kappa statistic directly. However, if this agreement is largely due to chance (e.g., driven by a skewed prevalence), Kappa will appropriately adjust for it. High raw agreement alone is not a cause of distortion.<br/><br/><b>Unequal distribution of diagnostic categories</b>: Unequal distribution can cause minor variability in Kappa but is less impactful than skewed prevalence. For example, if categories like 'diagnosed' and 'not diagnosed' are moderately unbalanced, the effect on Kappa is limited unless there is extreme skewness.<br/><br/><b>Use of a diagnostic tool with subjective criteria</b>: While subjective criteria can reduce inter-rater agreement, this reflects genuine disagreement rather than a distortion of Kappa. The statistic would appropriately reflect the lack of consistency between raters rather than being inherently biased.<br/><br/><b>Small sample size for assessing reliability</b>: Small sample size increases variability and reduces the precision of the Kappa estimate, but it does not systematically distort the statistic. The confidence intervals around Kappa will be wider, making the interpretation less robust, but this is not a flaw of Kappa itself.<br/></div>
