<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>In an attempt to better understand the religious needs of her patients, a psychiatrist creates a Likert scale questionnaire. The questionnaire is then given to 100 community patients. How is the data collected by the questionnaire best described?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Ordinal</span></div><br/>Likert scales are ordinal scales. A Likert scale offers respondents a number of options to each question. For example:<br/><br/>Question: <br/><br/>How often do you pray?<br/><br/>Answer:<br/><br/>Never<br/>Rarely<br/>Occasionally<br/>Frequently <br/>Daily<br/><br/>Such data is ordered (daily is more often than occasionally) but there is no consistent quantifiable difference between each option (the difference between daily and frequently is not necessarily the same as that between Rarely and occasionally).<br/></div>
