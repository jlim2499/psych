Mothers of children who have autism are much more likely to remember maternal drug exposure as they will have considered this in detail and have probably been asked about it by medical teams.<br/><br/>Recall bias is a major problem of case control studies (this is a clue in the question).</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>39.</b></td><td>A new test is able to detect brain tumours much earlier than previous methods.  Although it has no effect on the outcome it suggests it prolongs survival based on the fact that it detects the disease earlier.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Lead time bias</b> Lead time bias occurs when a new test appears to prolong survival but actually only offers earlier detection.<br/><br/>For example, people die of condition X at age 60.  The traditional test made a diagnosis at age 55.  The new test means the diagnosis can occur at age 20.  The time from diagnosis to death has gone from 5 to 40 years.  If presented incorrectly people could conclude that the new test increased survival by 35 years.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>40.</b></td><td>A systematic review incorrectly concludes that there is little evidence into the use of herbal medicines for depression.  The study failed to consider good evidence from China as these studies were ruled out as they were written in another language.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Language bias</b> Language bias is a form of reporting bias. This can occur when studies are only considered if they are in the language of the study authors.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/></div>
