<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A consultant psychiatrist is keen to evaluate the prevalence of borderline personality disorder in a South American country. He is familiar with a research instrument that could assist him but there is no available version in Spanish. He arranges for the instrument to be translated and then conducts a small study to establish if the translated version works equally well. What type of validity is the study attempting to assess?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Criterion </span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Criterion validity</b>. Criterion validity refers to the ability of a test to predict an outcome or behaviour in another context or time. In this case, the psychiatrist wants to assess whether the translated version of the research instrument can accurately identify borderline personality disorder as effectively as the original version did in a different language and cultural context. This is essentially comparing it against a 'criterion' - the original version of the tool.<br/><br/><b>Content validity</b>, while incorrect, is an important aspect of any assessment tool. It refers to whether or not a tool measures all aspects of the concept it is supposed to measure. For instance, if developing a questionnaire about depression, content validity would be concerned with ensuring that all relevant aspects of depression (e.g., mood, sleep patterns, appetite) are adequately covered by questions in the tool. However, in this scenario, there's no indication that content validity is being assessed.<br/><br/><b>Predictive validity</b> involves testing how well a tool predicts future outcomes or behaviours. If our psychiatrist was interested in how well his instrument predicted future mental health issues or treatment needs for those diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, he would be looking at predictive validity. But again, this isn't what's happening here.<br/><br/><b>Internal validity</b> concerns whether results obtained from a study are due purely to variables that were manipulated within it and not due to extraneous factors (e.g., researcher bias). It's crucial when establishing cause-and-effect relationships but doesn't apply directly to this case since we're dealing with translation and application of an existing diagnostic tool rather than conducting an experiment per se.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Face validity</b> pertains to whether a test appears (at face value) to measure what it claims to measure. It's more subjective and less formal than other types of validity because it relies on individual judgement rather than statistical analysis. Here, the psychiatrist isn't concerned with how the test appears to measure borderline personality disorder, but rather whether it does so accurately in a different language and cultural setting. Hence, face validity is not the correct answer either.<br/></div>
