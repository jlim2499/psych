A list of all the doctors that work in the hospital is drawn up and every 20th doctor on the list is invited for an interview with the human resource manager.<br/><br/></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Systematic sampling</b> <br/>Explanation for the Correct Answer:<br/><br/>Systematic sampling: The study described uses systematic sampling, as it involves selecting every 20th doctor from a list of all doctors working at the hospital for an interview. This method is a type of probability sampling where the first sample is chosen randomly, and subsequent samples are selected at regular intervals, which in this case is every 20th person on the list.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Stratified sampling: This would involve dividing the population into strata, or layers, based on certain characteristics, and then sampling from each stratum. This is not described in the study.<br/><br/>Snowball sampling: This is a non-probability sampling technique used in studies where potential subjects are hard to locate. Participants recruit other participants from among their acquaintances. Again, this is not what is being described.<br/><br/>Cluster sampling: Involves dividing the population into clusters and then randomly selecting entire clusters for study. The description does not indicate that clusters of doctors were selected.<br/><br/>Convenience sampling: This is a non-probability sampling technique where the sample is taken from a group of people easy to contact or to reach. This does not fit the description as the selection is systematic and not based on convenience.<br/><br/>Multistage sampling: This involves a combination of two or more sampling methods. For example, using cluster sampling first and then systematic sampling within each cluster. This is not indicated in the study described.<br/><br/>Quota sampling: This would involve collecting data from a hand-picked sample and is often used in market research. The sample members are chosen to meet a predetermined quota. This method is not described here.<br/><br/>Voluntary sampling: This would involve participants choosing to be part of the study on their own. The study described does not allow doctors to volunteer; they are systematically selected.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>248.</b></td><td>A study is conducted to investigate the burden of insomnia in the United Kingdom. A household list is taken from census data and a random set of households selected from the list. All members of the selected households are then interviewed and this data used to estimate the prevalence of insomnia.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Cluster sampling</b> <br/>Explanation for the Correct Answer:<br/><br/>Cluster sampling: The study described uses cluster sampling, where the population is divided into clusters (in this case, households based on census data), and a random selection of these clusters is made. Then, all members within the selected clusters (households) are included in the sample. This method is often used when it is impractical or costly to conduct a study with a simple random sample across the entire population.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Stratified sampling: This method involves dividing the population into subgroups (strata) based on shared characteristics and randomly sampling from each subgroup. The study does not indicate that households were divided into strata based on characteristics.<br/><br/>Snowball sampling: This is a non-probability sampling technique where existing study subjects recruit future subjects from among their acquaintances. This was not used in the study.<br/><br/>Convenience sampling: This method involves selecting subjects who are conveniently available to participate in the study. The study does not rely on convenience but rather on a random set of households.<br/><br/>Multistage sampling: While multistage sampling can include cluster sampling as one stage, it typically involves using different sampling methods at different stages. The description only indicates one stage, which is cluster sampling.<br/><br/>Simple random sampling: This would involve every individual in the population having an equal chance of being selected. While households are randomly selected, not all individuals in the population have an equal chance since the study includes all members of selected households.<br/><br/>Systematic sampling: This method involves selecting subjects based on a fixed periodic interval (every nth subject) from a list, which is not the method described here.<br/><br/>Quota sampling: Involves non-randomly selecting subjects to meet a pre-set quota, which is not mentioned in the study.<br/><br/>Voluntary sampling: This method relies on subjects volunteering to participate, which does not apply to this study.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>249.</b></td><td>A researcher is keen to know is there is a difference in income between dentists of different ethnic minorities. They conduct a study whereby they obtain a list of all dentists in the London area. They then separate the dentists into groups based on their ethnic minorities and take a random sample from within each group.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td> Stratified sampling Explanation for the Correct Answer:<br/><br/>Stratified sampling: This study is an example of stratified sampling because the researchers have divided the population of dentists into strata, or groups, based on their ethnic minorities. They then take a random sample from within each of these groups. Stratified sampling ensures that each subgroup of the population is represented in the sample, which is particularly useful when researchers are interested in making comparisons between different subgroups, such as ethnic minorities in this case.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Cluster sampling: This method involves dividing the population into clusters and then randomly selecting entire clusters to be included in the sample. Since the study involves separating individuals into groups based on a specific characteristic (ethnic minority) and sampling within each group, it is not cluster sampling.<br/><br/>Snowball sampling: This non-probability sampling technique is used when participants are hard to locate. It involves current subjects recruiting future subjects from among their acquaintances. This technique was not used in the study described.<br/><br/>Convenience sampling: This method involves selecting subjects who are easily accessible to the researcher, rather than based on random selection from stratified groups.<br/><br/>Multistage sampling: Involves using multiple sampling methods across different stages. The study described only indicates one stage with stratified sampling.<br/><br/>Simple random sampling: Involves selecting subjects such that each individual in the entire population has an equal chance of being chosen. This method was not used since the study specifically stratified the population before sampling.<br/><br/>Systematic sampling: This method involves selecting subjects at a regular interval from a list. The study does not indicate the use of intervals but rather random sampling within predefined strata.<br/><br/>Quota sampling: Involves non-randomly selecting subjects to meet a pre-set quota for each subgroup. The study, however, does not mention a quota but does mention random selection within groups.<br/><br/>Voluntary sampling: This method relies on subjects volunteering to participate, which does not apply to the stratified sampling approach used in this study.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/></div>
