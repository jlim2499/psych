<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A researcher hypothesises that a new drug will successfully treat depression.  He completes a study which suggests his hypothesis was correct when in fact it was not.  What has occurred?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Type I error</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Type I error = rejecting a true null hypothesis</div>The null hypothesis in this case would be:<br/><br/>Ho = The drug does not lead to a change in depression (either severity or prevalence, it doesn't matter for the sake of the question).<br/><br/>If his hypothesis (that the drug treats depression) is incorrect then the null hypothesis (Ho) is true.<br/><br/>He has concluded that the drug is effective when it was not and so has rejected the null when it was true (the drug did not improve depression). This is a type I error.<br/><br/>Type I errors relate to finding differences that do not exist.<br/></div>
