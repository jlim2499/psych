<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A new self-report measure for diagnosing generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is developed. To test its concurrent validity, which of the following would be most appropriate?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Comparing its scores to those of a validated GAD questionnaire administered concurrently</span></div><br/><i><b>Previous Exam Question</b></i><br/><br/>The correct answer is <b>Comparing its scores to those of a validated GAD questionnaire administered concurrently</b>. Concurrent validity evaluates whether a new measure correlates well with an established measure of the same construct at the same time. Administering a validated GAD questionnaire alongside the new tool is the best way to establish its concurrent validity.<br/><br/><b>Assessing if it predicts the severity of GAD symptoms six months later</b>: This pertains to predictive validity, which assesses how well a measure forecasts future outcomes or behaviour, not concurrent validity.<br/><br/><b>Comparing its scores to the results of a depression scale</b>: This addresses convergent or discriminant validity, depending on whether the goal is to assess overlap or distinguishability between related constructs like anxiety and depression. It does not measure concurrent validity.<br/><br/><b>Using it to predict patient dropout rates from therapy</b>: This evaluates predictive validity rather than concurrent validity. It measures whether the tool can predict a specific outcome, not its alignment with an existing measure.<br/><br/><b>Testing if its scores correlate with the clinician's subjective impressions of anxiety</b>: This approach evaluates criterion validity, where a measure is assessed against a 'gold standard'. While related, it is not specifically testing concurrent validity with another validated questionnaire.<br/></div>
