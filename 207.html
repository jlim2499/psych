<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is an example of selection bias?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Volunteer bias</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Volunteer bias</b>. Volunteer bias is a form of selection bias that occurs when individuals who choose to participate in a study differ significantly from those who do not. For example, in a study on mental health, individuals with mental health issues may be more likely to volunteer, potentially skewing the results towards more severe cases. Recognising volunteer bias is important in clinical research to ensure that study findings are generalisable to the broader population.<br/><br/><b>Incidence rate bias</b>: This is not a recognised form of selection bias. Incidence rate refers to the frequency of new cases occurring within a specific time period and is a measure used in epidemiology rather than a type of bias.<br/><br/><b>Late-look bias</b>: Late-look bias is an information bias, not selection bias. It occurs when data are collected at an inappropriate time, such as studying a fatal disease years later when some of the patients may have already died. This can result in an unrepresentative sample of survivors, but it is distinct from biases related to participant selection.<br/><br/><b>Lead time bias</b>: Lead time bias is another type of information bias that can affect studies evaluating screening interventions. It arises when early diagnosis increases the apparent survival time without truly affecting the disease course. For example, cancer screenings can create the illusion of extended survival if lead time bias is not accounted for.<br/><br/><b>Recall bias</b>: Recall bias is an information bias, particularly relevant in retrospective studies, where participants' ability to remember past exposures differs based on their outcome status. In psychiatry, recall bias can affect studies where patients with a diagnosis may recall negative exposures differently than healthy controls, influencing the perceived association between exposure and outcome.<br/></div>
