<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>In a long clinical questionnaire designed to assess symptoms of anxiety, a psychiatrist wants to ensure that splitting the items into two halves still yields consistent results. Which form of reliability is most relevant to assess this?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Split-half reliability</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Split-half reliability</b>. Split-half reliability assesses the internal consistency of a test by dividing it into two halves and comparing the results of each half. This approach is relevant here, as it ensures that both halves of the anxiety questionnaire measure the same construct consistently. High split-half reliability indicates that the items are cohesive and measure anxiety reliably throughout the test, making it a valuable measure in long questionnaires.<br/><br/><b>Parallel-forms reliability</b>: Parallel-forms reliability involves administering two equivalent forms of a test to the same group and comparing the results. It is useful for reducing practice effects but does not directly assess consistency within the same form by splitting it, making it irrelevant in this context.<br/><br/><b>Internal consistency reliability</b>: Internal consistency reliability is the degree to which items within a single test measure the same construct. It often uses statistical measures like Cronbach's alpha. While related to split-half reliability, it is a broader measure that does not specifically involve splitting the test in half.<br/><br/><b>Inter-rater reliability</b>: Inter-rater reliability assesses the consistency of scores between different raters or observers. It is essential in settings where multiple clinicians might assess the same patient, but it is not relevant here, as it does not involve comparing different parts of a single questionnaire.<br/><br/><b>Test-retest reliability</b>: Test-retest reliability assesses the stability of a test over time by administering it on two different occasions. This is not applicable in this case, as the goal is to assess consistency within the same test administration by splitting it, rather than stability over time.<br/></div>
