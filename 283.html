<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Dalman et al. (2001) studied 524 individuals with schizophrenia and 1043 matched controls for various obstetric complications, such as foetal growth impairment, birth asphyxia, pre-eclampsia, and prolonged hospital stay. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated before and after adjusting for potential confounders. <br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><a class="fancybox" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb032b.png" rel="group"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb032.png"/></a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"><a class="fancybox lbmagglasslink" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb032b.png" rel="group"><img src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/>Which exposure showed a statistically significant association with schizophrenia before adjustment, but then lost its significance once obstetric complications were taken into account?<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/><i>Dalman (2001) The British Journal of Psychiatry 179:403-8.</i> <br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Child remaining in the hospital</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Child remaining in the hospital</b>. In the unadjusted model, children who remained in hospital had a statistically significant increased odds of developing schizophrenia (OR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.2–2.6). This association persisted after adjusting for possible confounders (OR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1–2.8), but was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for other obstetric complications (OR 1.5, 95% CI: 0.8–2.9), as the confidence interval now includes 1. This suggests that the observed association may have been due to other perinatal complications rather than prolonged hospitalisation itself. Clinically, it reminds us to look beneath surface-level associations in the birth history when considering neurodevelopmental risk.<br/><br/><b>Lower birth weight</b> (0–2499g) showed a statistically significant association with schizophrenia in the unadjusted model (OR 1.8, 95% CI: 1.0–3.1), but the confidence interval just touches 1.0, making it borderline. However, like ‘child remaining in hospital’, this association lost significance after adjustment. But because the question asks which exposure lost significance after adjustment, and more than one technically fits that, it could introduce ambiguity — suggesting this answer could also be defensible depending on interpretation.<br/><br/><b>Pre-eclampsia</b> never reached statistical significance in any model, with ORs always having confidence intervals that included 1. For example, even after adjusting for confounders, the OR was 1.9 (95% CI: 0.8–5.0), and fully adjusted OR was 0.9 (0.3–3.0). Clinically, this suggests that pre-eclampsia is unlikely to be a significant standalone risk factor for schizophrenia.<br/><br/><b>Delay in gaining weight</b> was never statistically significant in any model, with confidence intervals consistently including 1.0. For example, the unadjusted OR was 1.9 (95% CI: 1.0–3.4), which does not meet the threshold for statistical significance. This undermines the use of this variable as a meaningful clinical predictor of schizophrenia risk.<br/><br/><b>None of the studied factors</b> is incorrect. At least one factor — prolonged hospitalisation — did show a statistically significant association in unadjusted and confounder-adjusted models, although this association disappeared after controlling for obstetric complications. This confirms that some studied factors were indeed associated with schizophrenia risk in at least one analysis model.<br/></div>
