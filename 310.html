<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A pilot scheme is introduced into a psychiatric hospital which provides HIV screening for all new patients that are admitted. As part of an economic evaluation of the scheme a researcher makes an assessment of the costs associated with providing the screening service. How should the potential anxiety experienced by people awaiting the outcome of the screening test be classified?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Intangible cost</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Intangible cost</b>. Intangible costs are non-monetary costs that cannot be easily quantified. They include factors such as pain, suffering, and anxiety. In this case, the potential anxiety experienced by people awaiting the outcome of the HIV screening test would fall under this category. It's not a direct financial expense associated with providing the screening service, but it does represent a type of cost to those individuals undergoing testing.<br/><br/><b>Direct cost</b> is incorrect because these are expenses that can be directly tied to a specific project or program. In this scenario, examples of direct costs would include the cost of HIV test kits or salaries for healthcare workers administering the tests.<br/><br/><b>Capital cost</b> refers to one-time significant expenditures on property, infrastructure or equipment used in the provision of health services. This option is also incorrect because anxiety experienced by patients does not fall into any of these categories.<br/><br/>The option <b>Semi-fixed cost</b> is incorrect as well. Semi-fixed costs change with volume, but not in direct proportion. For example, if more patients were admitted to the hospital and required HIV testing, semi-fixed costs might include hiring additional staff or purchasing more testing equipment - they increase with volume but not on a per-patient basis like direct costs.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Indirect cost</b> is also an incorrect answer choice. Indirect costs refer to ongoing operational expenses that support overall operations but cannot be directly attributed to a particular service or program. Examples could include utilities and administrative overheads for running the hospital where screenings are taking place.<br/><br/></div>
