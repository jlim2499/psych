<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Berkson's bias refers to bias arising from which of the following?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Different rates of admission to hospital</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Different rates of admission to hospital</b>. Berkson's bias, also known as admission rate bias, arises in hospital-based studies where there is an artificial association created between the disease under study and other diseases due to different rates of hospital admissions. For example, if a study is conducted in a hospital setting on the relationship between diabetes and hypertension, it may show a higher correlation than in the general population because patients with both conditions are more likely to be admitted.<br/><br/>The option <b>When articles of high citation are easy to reach and have higher chance to be entered into a given study</b> refers to citation bias. This occurs when researchers preferentially cite studies whose results support their own findings or hypotheses. This can lead to overrepresentation of certain viewpoints or findings in the literature.<br/><br/><b>Certain studies not being published</b> describes publication bias. This happens when studies with positive or significant results are more likely to be published than those with negative or non-significant results. As a result, systematic reviews and meta-analyses that rely on published data may overestimate the true effect size.<br/><br/><b>When certain patients are excluded for example if they are considered ineligible</b> refers to selection bias. In this scenario, some individuals are systematically excluded from participation in a study based on their characteristics (e.g., age, sex, comorbidities), which can skew the study results.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>When participants alter their usual behaviour due to their awareness that they are being studied</b> is termed as Hawthorne effect. It is a form of observation bias where people modify an aspect of their behaviour in response to their awareness of being observed which can influence the outcome of the study.<br/><br/></div>
