Within a population, a parameter is a fixed value that does not vary.  Examples include:-<br/> <br/><ul><li>The true average height of human males</li><li>The median income in Egypt</li></ul><br/>It is often not possible know the value of a parameter as this would involve collecting data from all the individuals in a population. The next best option is to take a sample and then to make estimates of the parameters (these are called statistics).<br/><br/>Parametric statistical procedures rely on assumptions about the shape of the distribution (i.e., assume a normal distribution) in the underlying population and about the form or parameters (i.e., means and standard deviations) of the assumed distribution. <br/><br/>Nonparametric statistical procedures rely on no or few assumptions about the shape or parameters of the population distribution from which the sample was drawn.<br/><br/>Examples of parametric tests include:<br/><br/><ul><li>t-test</li><li>ANOVA</li><li>Pearson coefficient of correlation </li></ul><br/>Examples of non-parametric tests include:<br/><br/><ul><li>Mann-Whitney Test</li><li>Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test</li><li>Kruskal-Wallis Test</li><li>Fisher Exact Probability test</li></ul></div></div>
