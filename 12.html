<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Considering the following abstract, which of the following methods was used in the study?<br/>An international expert task force in this field developed consensus. Twenty-seven experts were invited to participate and 91% of them agreed. Initial survey items were gathered from the content of literature search (systematic review). This included open-ended questions inviting participants to add suggestions by e-mail correspondence. After this initial first round, the study was conducted online using Google Forms. Survey items were rated on a 5-point scale. Items rated by at least 80% of experts as essential or important were included. Items rated as essential or important by 65-79% of experts were included in the next survey for re-rating. Items with consensus below to 65% were rejected and excluded.<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">The Delphi method</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>The Delphi method</b>. The Delphi method is a structured communication technique, originally developed as a systematic, interactive forecasting method which relies on a panel of experts. In the provided abstract, the process described aligns with this method: an initial survey is conducted (round one), followed by iterative rounds where items are re-rated based on consensus reached in previous rounds. This process continues until a predefined level of consensus is achieved. As stated in the abstract, 'Items rated by at least 80% of experts as essential or important were included.' This indicates that the Delphi method was used.<br/><br/><b>Triangulation</b> is incorrect because it refers to the use of more than one approach or perspective in research to study the same phenomenon. It's not evident from the abstract that multiple methods or perspectives were used concurrently to validate findings.<br/><br/><b>Bootstrapping</b> is also incorrect. Bootstrapping in statistics is a resampling procedure that involves sampling datasets with replacement from an original dataset and calculating summary statistics for each sample. There's no indication from the provided text that such statistical techniques were used.<br/><br/><b>Multi-Modal Method</b> isn't correct either. Multi-modal methods involve using multiple modes or ways of collecting data for research purposes – for example, combining interviews, surveys, and observations. Although multiple steps are described in this study (e.g., email correspondence and online surveys), they all contribute to a single mode of data collection – expert opinion – rather than representing distinct modes.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>Analytic induction</b> doesn't fit either because it's an approach where researchers develop explanations about phenomena through intensive investigation and refining of those explanations during data collection until they can account for all observed cases. However, there's no mention in the abstract about developing or refining explanations based on observed cases; instead, consensus among experts was sought regarding certain items.<br/></div>
