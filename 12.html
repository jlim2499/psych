<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following scales requires the clinician to have previous experience with the patient's condition?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Clinical global impression</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Clinical global impression</b>. The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness, their overall improvement or change, and the efficacy of treatments, based on the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. This makes it necessary for the clinician to have previous experience with the patient's condition to make an informed and accurate assessment.<br/><br/><b>Global assessment of functioning</b> does not require the clinician to have previous experience with the patient's condition. This scale measures the overall level of functioning of an individual in terms of psychological, social, and occupational domains, but it does not require specific experience with the patient's particular condition.<br/><br/><b>Edinburgh postnatal major depression scale</b> is a self-rated scale and does not require the clinician to have prior experience with the patient’s condition. It is specifically designed to identify postnatal depression and can be administered without specialised knowledge of the patient’s previous mental health history.<br/><br/><b>Geriatric depression scale</b> is another self-rated scale, designed to screen for depression in older adults. It is straightforward for patients to complete and does not necessitate that the clinician has any prior experience with the patient's condition.<br/><br/><b>Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale</b> is a clinician-rated scale, but it is designed to be used to assess the severity of depressive episodes and monitor changes over time. While it requires some clinical knowledge to administer correctly, it does not specifically require previous experience with the patient's particular condition.<br/></div>
