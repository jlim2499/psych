<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A senior psychiatrist, is explaining a 95% confidence interval (CI) to a junior doctor who brought a research article about a new ADHD medication. The study shows an average symptom reduction with a 95% CI of [15, 25]. The junior asks if this means there's a 95% chance that their patient’s symptoms will reduce within that range when taking the drug. <br/>Which of the following best explains the meaning of the 95% CI in this context?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">If the study was repeated an infinite number of times, 95% of the confidence intervals calculated would contain the true average symptom reduction</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>If the study was repeated an infinite number of times, 95% of the confidence intervals calculated would contain the true average symptom reduction.</b> This option correctly describes the concept of a 95% confidence interval (CI). It means that if we could hypothetically repeat the study many times, 95% of those calculated CIs would include the true average effect of the treatment for the entire population. This interpretation is crucial in understanding CIs as measures of the precision of an estimate for a population parameter, not as predictive tools for individual patient outcomes. Clinically, this reinforces the importance of understanding that CIs reflect group-level data and help us generalise findings to a larger population, rather than predicting individual patient responses.<br/><br/><b>There is a 95% chance that the symptom reduction for an individual patient will fall between 15 and 25.</b> This is incorrect because the CI does not provide information about the likelihood of an individual patient’s outcome. A CI is about the estimated range for the population mean, not individual results. Using the CI in this way could lead to false assumptions about patient outcomes, creating unrealistic expectations of treatment efficacy for individual cases.<br/><br/><b>95% of patients will experience a symptom reduction between 15 and 25.</b> This option is incorrect because a CI does not make claims about how many patients will fall within this range. It’s a statistical statement about the average effect for the population, not the distribution of individual responses. In clinical practice, interpreting a CI this way would ignore the variability seen in patient responses, potentially leading to inaccurate expectations and treatment plans.<br/><br/><b>This interval predicts that future symptom reductions will fall within the range of 15 to 25, 95% of the time.</b> This is also incorrect because CIs are not designed to predict individual future outcomes. They provide an estimated range where the population mean is likely to fall if the study is repeated. Misinterpreting a CI this way could lead to overconfidence in the treatment’s predictability and overlook the need for tailored monitoring and adjustments based on individual response variability.<br/><br/><b>There is a 95% probability that the symptom reduction will be exactly within the range of 15 to 25 for this specific study sample.</b> This is incorrect because the CI doesn’t describe probabilities about the specific study sample’s observed data. Instead, it reflects the likely range of the true population mean, assuming the study could be repeated. Applying the CI to the sample data could lead to confusion, suggesting more certainty in the study results than is statistically justified. This misunderstanding could result in clinicians or patients viewing the CI as a guarantee rather than an estimate based on a sample.<br/></div>
