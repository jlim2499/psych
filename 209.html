There are 250 children in the control group and 150 children assigned to take the new drug. After 4 months 100 children in the control group had had a seizure compared to 15 children in the group taking the new medication. What is the relative risk reduction?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">75%</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">RRR = ARR / CER</div>The correct answer is <b>75%</b>. This is calculated by determining the relative risk reduction (RRR), which measures the proportionate decrease in the event (seizures) rate in the treatment group compared to the control group.<br/><br/>First, we calculate the event rate in the control group (100/250 = 0.4 or 40%) and in the treatment group (15/150 = 0.1 or 10%). The absolute risk reduction (ARR) is the difference between these two rates (40% - 10% = 30%). The RRR is then calculated by dividing the ARR by the event rate in the control group (30%/40% = 0.75 or 75%).<br/><br/><b>30%</b>: This is incorrect because it represents the absolute risk reduction (ARR), not the relative risk reduction. ARR measures the simple difference in event rates between the control and treatment groups.<br/><br/><b>4</b>: This is incorrect because it appears to misunderstand the concept of relative risk reduction. The number 4 might reflect a misunderstanding related to the risk ratio rather than the relative risk reduction.<br/><br/><b>3.33</b>: This is incorrect because it does not represent either the ARR, RRR, or any other key metric commonly used in evaluating clinical trial outcomes. This number might result from misinterpreting a step in the calculation.<br/><br/><b>40%</b>: This is incorrect because it underestimates the relative risk reduction. It might be confused with the control event rate, but it does not answer the question about risk reduction.<br/><br/><b>5.2%</b>: This is incorrect because it does not relate to the relative risk reduction calculation and could be mistakenly derived from incorrect proportions of the event rates.<br/><br/><b>7.2%</b>: This is incorrect as it represents an unrelated percentage and is not involved in calculating the relative risk reduction from the provided trial data.<br/><br/><b>3.1%</b>: This is incorrect and does not correspond to the relative risk reduction or any other key statistic relevant to the clinical trial data.<br/><br/>This question is important clinically because it emphasises understanding the concept of relative risk reduction, which is essential in determining the effectiveness of interventions in reducing the likelihood of adverse events. Correct interpretation aids in making informed treatment decisions for patients, highlighting the drug's effectiveness in reducing seizures in children with absence seizures.<br/></div>
