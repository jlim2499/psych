<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A group of new tests are developed to screen for bulimia. Each screening test is tested against a gold standard (a structured clinical examination using ICD criteria). Following the tests, ROC curves are plotted, and the AUC is calculated for each screening test.<br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid1"><thead><tr><th>Test</th><th>AUC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Test 1</td><td>0.42</td></tr><tr><td>Test 2</td><td>0.95</td></tr><tr><td>Test 3</td><td>0.82</td></tr><tr><td>Test 4</td><td>0.11</td></tr><tr><td>Test 5</td><td>0.67</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>Based on the AUCs seen in the table below, which of the tests  performed best overall at distinguishing between bulimia being present or absent?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Test 2</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Test 2</b>. Test 2 has an AUC of 0.95, which is the highest among all the tests. A higher AUC value indicates better performance in distinguishing between bulimia being present or absent. This high AUC suggests that Test 2 has excellent discriminative ability, making it the most effective screening tool among those tested.<br/><br/><b>Test 1</b> is not correct. Test 1 has an AUC of 0.42, which is lower than 0.5, indicating that its performance is worse than random chance. This test would not be reliable for screening bulimia as it fails to effectively distinguish between individuals with and without the condition.<br/><br/><b>Test 3</b> is not correct. Test 3 has an AUC of 0.82, which indicates good discriminative ability. However, it is still lower than the AUC of Test 2, making it less effective in comparison.<br/><br/><b>Test 4</b> is not correct. Test 4 has an AUC of 0.11, which is very poor. This test performs significantly worse than random chance and is highly ineffective at distinguishing between the presence or absence of bulimia.<br/><br/><b>Test 5</b> is not correct. Test 5 has an AUC of 0.67, indicating moderate performance. While it is better than Tests 1 and 4, it is still less effective than Tests 2 and 3 in distinguishing between individuals with and without bulimia.<br/></div>
