<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following databases is dedicated to literature produced by organisations outside of the traditional commercial or academic publishing and distribution channels?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">OpenGrey</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">SIGLE is for 'grey literature'.</div>The correct answer is <b>OpenGrey</b>. OpenGrey is a multidisciplinary database that provides open access to scholarly grey literature. Grey literature refers to materials and research produced by organisations outside of the traditional commercial or academic publishing and distribution channels. These can include reports, working papers, government documents, white papers and evaluations.<br/><br/>Moving on to the incorrect answers:<br/><br/><b>CINAHL</b> (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) is an index of English-language and selected other-language journal articles about nursing, allied health, biomedicine and healthcare. It does not specialise in 'grey literature' but rather focuses on nursing and allied health disciplines.<br/><br/><b>Embase</b>, another incorrect answer, is a biomedical research literature database from Elsevier. It covers a wide range of fields within biomedical science and includes indexed journals not found in PubMed. However, it does not specifically focus on grey literature.<br/><br/><b>PsychINFO</b>, developed by the American Psychological Association (APA), is an important database for accessing research related to the field of psychology. It contains citations and summaries dating back to the 1800s but does not concentrate on grey literature.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>MEDLARS</b> (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System) was one of the first computerised biomedical bibliographic retrieval systems. Today it has evolved into what we know as PubMed/MEDLINE - again this doesn't focus primarily on grey literature but rather published biomedical studies.<br/><br/>In conclusion, while all these databases are valuable resources for medical professionals seeking information in their respective fields, only OpenGrey specialises in providing access to grey literature produced outside traditional publishing channels.<br/><br/></div>
