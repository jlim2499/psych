<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is true regarding the standard deviation?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">It can never be negative</span></div><br/>The correct answer is '<b>It can never be negative</b>'. The standard deviation, a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values, is always a positive value or zero. It's calculated as the square root of the variance, and since the square root of a number cannot be negative, the standard deviation can never be negative.<br/><br/>The first option '<b>The lowest value it can have is 1</b>' is incorrect. The smallest possible standard deviation is 0, which occurs when all numbers in a set are equal (there is no dispersion). <br/><br/>The second option '<b>It is not affected by outliers</b>' is also incorrect. Standard deviation, being a measure that takes into account all values in a data set, can indeed be affected by outliers. If an outlier (a data point that differs significantly from other observations) is present in the data set, it will increase the standard deviation because it increases the overall dispersion.<br/><br/>The fourth option '<b>It has different units to the original data</b>' is not true either. One of the properties of standard deviation is that it's expressed in the same units as the original data. This makes it easier for interpretation and comparison with mean or median.<br/><br/>Finally, '<b>It is calculated by multiplying the variance with the mean</b>' is incorrect. The standard deviation isn't calculated by multiplying these two figures. Instead, it's derived by taking square root of variance which itself involves squaring differences between individual observations and their mean.<br/></div>
