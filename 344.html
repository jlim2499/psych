The negative predictive value (NPV) is the probability that a person with a negative test result truly does not have the disease. This is calculated by dividing the number of true negatives (TN) by the total number of people who tested negative (TN + FN). Clinically, the NPV is crucial in screening tests where ruling out a disease is essential, such as excluding serious conditions like sepsis in a paediatric emergency setting. If a test has a high NPV, clinicians can be more confident that patients with a negative result are unlikely to have the disease.<br/><br/><b>TP / (TP + FP)</b> is the formula for positive predictive value (PPV), not NPV. PPV provides the likelihood that a person with a positive test result actually has the disease. While important for confirming diagnoses, it is not relevant to calculating NPV, which focuses on negative results.<br/><br/><b>TN / (TN + FP)</b> is the formula for specificity, which measures the test's ability to correctly identify individuals without the disease. Specificity is useful for understanding the test's performance but does not address the probability that a negative test result is accurate (NPV).<br/><br/><b>Sensitivity / (1 - specificity)</b> is the formula for the likelihood ratio positive (LR+), not for NPV. LR+ assesses how much more likely a positive test result is in someone with the disease compared to someone without it, which does not directly address the question of NPV.<br/><br/><b>TP / (TP + FN)</b> is the formula for sensitivity, which measures the testâ€™s ability to correctly identify individuals with the disease. Sensitivity helps in avoiding false negatives but does not relate to the NPV, which assesses the accuracy of negative test results.<br/></div>
