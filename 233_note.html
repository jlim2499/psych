It describes, either explicitly or implicitly, the purpose of the qualitative research, the role of the researcher(s), the stages of research, and the method of data analysis.<br/><br/>Ethnography:<br/><br/>The emphasis in ethnography is on studying an entire culture.  The most common ethnographic approach is participant observation as a part of field research. The ethnographer becomes immersed in the culture as an active participant and records extensive field notes. As in grounded theory, there is no pre-set limiting of what will be observed and no real ending point in an ethnographic study.<br/><br/>Phenomenology:<br/><br/>Phenomenology is a qualitative research approach that seeks to understand the subjective experience of individuals by exploring the meaning they attach to their lived experiences. It involves the study of how individuals experience and make sense of the world around them, without imposing any preconceived notions or theories.<br/><br/>Phenomenological research is typically conducted through in-depth interviews with participants who have experienced a particular phenomenon of interest. The researcher uses open-ended questions to encourage participants to describe their experiences in as much detail as possible. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of how the participants experience the phenomenon, including their thoughts, feelings, and perceptions.<br/><br/>The data collected through interviews is analysed using a process called 'bracketing.' This involves setting aside any preconceived notions or biases that the researcher may have and analysing the data objectively. The researcher looks for patterns and themes in the data, and then identifies the essential features of the phenomenon being studied.<br/><br/>Grounded Theory:<br/><br/>The purpose of grounded theory is to develop theory about phenomena of interest. The theory needs to be grounded or rooted in observation, hence the term. <br/><br/>Grounded theory is a complex process. The research begins with the raising of generative questions which help to guide the research but are not intended to be either static or confining. Core theoretical concepts are gradually identified. Tentative linkages are developed between the theoretical core concepts and the data. This early phase of the research tends to be very open and can take months. Later on the researcher is more engaged in verification and summary. The effort tends to evolve toward one core category that is central.<br/><br/><b>Methods</b><br/><br/>The most common methods used, particularly in healthcare research, are interviews and focus groups.<br/><br/><b>Sampling</b><br/><br/>Convenience (or opportunistic) sampling:<br/><br/>Convenience sampling is a form of non-probability sampling in which the ease with which potential participants can be located or recruited is the primary consideration.<br/><br/>It is a technique that uses an open period of recruitment that continues until a set number of subjects, events, or institutions are enrolled. Here, selection is based on a first-come, first-served basis.<br/><br/>Purposive sampling:<br/><br/>In purposive sampling, participants are selected on purpose because the researcher already know that they have characteristics that are of interest for the study. For example, a researcher wants to evaluate the mental health support within a university so they target students who are currently using mental health support and those waiting to receive support.<br/><br/>Quota sampling is sometimes considered a type of purposive sampling. In quota sampling, we decide while designing the study how many people with which characteristics to include as participants. Quota sampling is more specific with respect to sizes and proportions of subsamples, with subgroups chosen to reflect corresponding proportions in the population.<br/><br/>Snowball sampling (aka chain referral sampling):<br/><br/>Participants or informants with whom contact has already been made use their social networks to refer the researcher to other people who could potentially participate in or contribute to the study. Snowball sampling is often used to find and recruit 'hidden populations', that is, groups not easily accessible to researchers through other sampling strategies.<br/><br/>Case study sampling:<br/><br/>This involves selecting a single individual, institution, or event.<br/><br/><b>Sample size (data saturation) </b><br/><br/>Sample size can be difficult to determine in qualitative research at the start of a study. In practice, the number of required subjects usually becomes obvious as the study progresses, as new categories, themes or explanations stop emerging from the data (data saturation).<br/><br/><b>Ensuring credibility and trustworthiness / validity</b><br/><br/>Triangulation:<br/><br/>Triangulation compares the results from either two or more different methods of data collection (for example, interviews and observation) or, more simply, two or more data sources (for example, interviews with members of different interest groups).<br/><br/>Respondent validation (aka member checking):<br/><br/>Respondent validation, or member checking, includes techniques in which the investigator's account is compared with those of the research subjects to establish the level of correspondence between the two sets.<br/><br/>Bracketing: <br/><br/>Bracketing is a methodological device of phenomenological inquiry that requires deliberate putting aside ones own belief about the phenomenon under investigation or what one already knows about the subject prior to and throughout the phenomenological investigation.<br/><br/>Reflexivity:<br/><br/>Reflexivity means sensitivity to the ways in which the researcher and the research process have shaped the collected data, including the role of prior assumptions and experience, which can influence even the most avowedly inductive inquiries.<br/><br/><b>Analytical approaches</b><br/><br/>Content analysis:<br/><br/>Interviews, both individual and group, are transcribed to produce texts that can be used to generate coding categories and to test theories. This can involve enumerating procedures such as counting word frequencies, sometimes aided by computer software.<br/><br/>Constant comparison:<br/><br/>This is an approach based on grounded theory. It allows researchers to identify the themes that are important (i.e. important in answering the research question) in a systematic way, providing an audit trail as they proceed. The method is used by the researcher to develop concepts from the data by coding and analysing at the same time.</div></div>
