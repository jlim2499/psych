<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>You record the weight of all of your patients on your ward.  You discover that the distribution of the measurements is skewed.  Which of the following would you use to describe the average weight of your patients?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Median</span></div><br/>Explanation for the Correct Answer:<br/><br/>Median is the correct option. When a data set is skewed, the mean can be misleading because it is affected by extreme values. The median, being the middle value of the dataset when ordered from the lowest to the highest, is not influenced by outliers and therefore provides a better measure of central tendency for skewed distributions.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Mode refers to the most frequently occurring value in a data set and does not necessarily reflect the central tendency, especially in skewed distributions.<br/><br/>Interquartile range is a measure of statistical dispersion, showing the range within which the central 50% of data lies. It does not describe the average weight of the patients.<br/><br/>Mean is the arithmetic average of the data set and can be skewed by outliers in a skewed distribution, making it an unreliable measure of central tendency in this context.<br/><br/>Variance is a measure of the spread of a set of data points. It does not describe the average but rather the variability or dispersion around the mean.<br/></div>
