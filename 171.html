<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is dedicated to providing full text articles of systematic reviews of the effects of healthcare interventions?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">CDSR (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews)</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>CDSR</b> (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews). The CDSR is a database that provides full-text articles of systematic reviews which evaluate the effects of healthcare interventions. These reviews are highly regarded in evidence-based medicine due to their comprehensive nature and rigorous methodology. They often include meta-analyses, where data from multiple studies are combined to provide a more robust estimate of the effect of an intervention.<br/><br/><b>SIGLE</b> (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) is incorrect as it primarily focuses on grey literature, which includes reports, theses, conference papers and other non-peer-reviewed material produced largely outside traditional publishing channels. While SIGLE may contain some systematic reviews, this is not its primary focus.<br/><br/><b>CINAHL</b> (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) is also incorrect. Although CINAHL does include some systematic reviews within its large collection of nursing and allied health literature, it does not exclusively provide full text articles of systematic reviews assessing healthcare interventions. <br/><br/>The <b>NHS EED</b> (NHS Economic Evaluation Database) is another incorrect option. NHS EED contains abstracts of quality-assessed economic evaluations and details about the cost-effectiveness of different treatments and care pathways but does not provide full text articles dedicated to systematic reviews.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>DARE</b> (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects) is incorrect as well because while DARE used to be a useful resource for abstracts of published systematic reviews in health care from around the world, it stopped updating in 2015 due to lack of funding. It did not provide full text articles either.<br/><br/>In conclusion, while all these databases have their unique strengths and uses within healthcare research or practice, only CDSR specifically provides full text articles dedicated to systematic reviews evaluating healthcare interventions.<br/></div>
