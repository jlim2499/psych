<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Regarding box and whisker plots which of the following is true?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">The box represents the central 50% of the data </span></div><br/>Explanation for the Correct Answer:<br/><br/>The box represents the central 50% of the data is the correct statement. In a box and whisker plot, the box itself represents the interquartile range (IQR), which encompasses the middle 50% of the dataset, from the first quartile (Q1, 25th percentile) to the third quartile (Q3, 75th percentile).<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>The quartiles are highly sensitive to outliers is incorrect because the quartiles (including the median) are measures of central tendency that are robust against outliers, unlike the mean.<br/><br/>Each whisker represents approximately 25% of the data is incorrect because the whiskers typically extend to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5 times the IQR from the lower and upper quartiles, respectively, not a fixed percentage of the data.<br/><br/>They are used to summarise the mean and standard deviation is incorrect because box plots typically summarize the median and quartiles (Q1 and Q3) of the dataset, not the mean and standard deviation.<br/><br/>The IQR is represented by Q3-Q1 is the correct representation of the IQR, not Q2-Q3. Q2 refers to the median, which is not directly used in calculating the IQR.<br/><br/>The box represents the central 25% of the data is incorrect as the box spans the IQR, which is the central 50% of the data, not 25%.<br/></div>
