The scatter plot shows a downward trend where the complex figure recall delay decreases as the duration of epilepsy increases. The correlation coefficient (r = -0.513) supports the observation of a moderate negative relationship between the two variables.<br/><br/><b>Strong negative non-linear correlation</b> is incorrect because the scatter plot demonstrates a linear relationship rather than a non-linear one. The data points form a roughly straight line rather than a curved pattern.<br/><br/><b>Weak negative linear correlation</b> is incorrect because the correlation coefficient of -0.513 indicates a moderate, not weak, relationship. The points show a clearer downward trend than would be expected in a weak correlation.<br/><br/><b>Strong positive non-linear correlation</b> is incorrect because the relationship is both negative and linear. The data does not support a strong positive correlation, nor does it show a non-linear pattern.<br/><br/><b>No correlation</b> is incorrect because there is a clear negative trend in the data points, indicating an association between the variables. The correlation coefficient and the p-value (p = 0.005) further confirm that there is a statistically significant relationship.<br/></div>
