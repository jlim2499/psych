The test is positive in 16 of the 20 patients who are proven to have an eating disorder. Of the remaining patients, only 10 have a positive test. What is the negative predictive value of the new test?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">890/894 = 99.6%</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>890/894 = 99.6%</b>. This is the correct calculation for the negative predictive value (NPV), which is the proportion of patients who tested negative and indeed do not have the disorder. The formula for NPV is <b>True Negatives / (False Negatives + True Negatives)</b>, which in this case is <b>890 / (4 + 890) = 99.6%</b>.<br/><br/><b>900/920 = 97.8%</b>: This option incorrectly uses the total number of patients (920) as the denominator rather than focusing on the relevant subset of patients who tested negative. This does not represent the NPV and is, therefore, incorrect.<br/><br/><b>890/900 = 98.9%</b>: This option mistakenly calculates what would be the specificity rather than the NPV. Specificity is calculated as <b>True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Positives)</b>, which is different from the NPV.<br/><br/><b>10/900 = 1.1%</b>: This option represents the proportion of false positives within the group that tested negative, which is not the correct calculation for NPV.<br/><br/><b>890/920 = 96.7%</b>: This option incorrectly uses the total number of patients tested as the denominator instead of correctly focusing on those who tested negative. This approach does not yield the correct NPV.<br/></div>
