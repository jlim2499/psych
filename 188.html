<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>The following image shows five ROC curves. Select the curve that corresponds with the least accurate test?<br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mma058.png"/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">A</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>A</b>. Curve A corresponds to the least accurate test because it is closest to the diagonal line, which represents a test with no discriminative power (i.e., no better than random guessing). In clinical practice, this would result in poor identification of true positives and a high rate of false positives and negatives, making it unsuitable for reliable diagnosis.<br/><br/><b>B</b> is not correct. Curve B shows better performance than curve A as it is further from the diagonal line, indicating a higher level of sensitivity and specificity. However, it is still not the most accurate among the curves presented.<br/><br/><b>C</b> is not correct. Curve C demonstrates better accuracy than both curves A and B. It is further from the diagonal and closer to the top-left corner, indicating improved sensitivity and specificity. Nonetheless, there are still better-performing curves in the graph.<br/><br/><b>D</b> is not correct. Curve D has even higher accuracy than curves A, B, and C. It is closer to the top-left corner, showing good discriminative ability. However, it is still not the most accurate test.<br/><br/><b>E</b> is not correct. Curve E represents the most accurate test among those presented, as it is closest to the top-left corner of the ROC space. This indicates the highest sensitivity and specificity, making it the best test for reliable diagnosis in clinical practice.<br/></div>
