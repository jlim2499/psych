<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>In 2010 researchers reported on an economic evaluation comparing a stepped care preventive intervention for depression and anxiety disorders in older people at high risk of these conditions, compared with routine primary care.<br/>The economic evaluation was conducted alongside a pragmatic randomised controlled trial. Consenting individuals presenting with sub-threshold levels of depressive or anxiety symptoms were randomly assigned to a preventive stepped care programme (n = 86) or to routine primary care (n = 84).<br/><br/>The study concluded that the prevention programme generated depression- and anxiety-free survival years in the older population at affordable cost.<br/><br/>The ICER was calculated as = (Costs-exp  Costs-ctr)/(Effects-exp  Effects-ctr), where Costs is the average annual per capita cost and Effects is the percentage of participants who did not develop depression or anxiety in the two groups (subscripted exp and ctr respectively). In this study, in which the incremental costs were 532 and the incremental effects were 0.12, the mean ICER was estimated at  532/0.12 = 4367 for a depression/anxiety-free year.<br/><br/>What type of economic evaluation did the study perform?<br/><br/><i>Veer-Tazelaar (2010) Cost-effectiveness of a stepped care intervention to prevent depression and anxiety in late life: randomised trial. The British Journal of Psychiatry Mar, 196 (4) 319-325.</i><br/><br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Cost-effectiveness analysis</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">ICER (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) = statistic used in cost-effectiveness analysis</div>The correct answer is <b>Cost-effectiveness analysis</b>. This type of economic evaluation was used in the study as it compares the costs and effects (outcomes) of two or more interventions. In this case, the researchers compared a stepped care preventive intervention for depression and anxiety disorders with routine primary care. The outcome measure was 'depression/anxiety-free years', which is a specific health effect rather than a measure of utility or monetary benefit. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), calculated as (Costs-exp Costs-ctr)/(Effects-exp Effects-ctr), is a common result in cost-effectiveness analyses.<br/><br/><b>Cost-utility analysis</b> would be incorrect because this type of economic evaluation measures outcomes in terms of utility, typically using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). In the given study, the outcome was not measured in these units but in 'depression/anxiety-free years'.<br/><br/><b>Cost-benefit analysis</b> would also be incorrect because this form of economic evaluation converts both costs and outcomes into monetary units to determine if an intervention is worthwhile. This allows for a direct comparison between costs and benefits, but it was not used in this study as the outcomes were not monetised.<br/><br/><b>Cost-minimisation analysis</b> would be inappropriate here because this type of economic evaluation assumes that the outcomes of the alternatives being compared are equivalent, so only costs are considered. However, in this study, there were differences in outcomes between the stepped care programme and routine primary care.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Cost outcome description</b>, while it might sound related, is not an actual recognised method of economic evaluation within health economics. Therefore, it cannot be the correct answer.<br/></div>
