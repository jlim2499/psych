A variable may also be called a data item. Age, sex, business income and expenses, country of birth, capital expenditure, class grades, eye colour and vehicle type are examples of variables. It is called a variable because the value may vary between data units in a population.<br/><br/>The three main variables in a typical study are the, independent, dependent and controlled variables.<br/><br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mma162.png"/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/>The independent variable is something that the experimenter purposely changes over the course of the investigation. <br/><br/>The dependent variable is the one that is observed and changes in response to the independent variable. <br/><br/>During the experiment all other variables should be controlled.  The variables that are not changed are called controlled variables.<br/><br/>Dependent variables are affected by independent variables but not by controlled variables as these do not vary throughout the study.<br/><br/><b>Example</b><br/><br/>A researcher wants to test the effectiveness of a new weight loss medication. They split participants into three groups. The first group receives a placebo (0mg dosage), the second group a 10 mg dose and the third group a 40 mg dose. After six months the participants weights are measured.<br/><br/>The independent variable is the dosage of the medication as that is what is being manipulated.<br/><br/>The dependent variable is the weight as that is what is being measured. Dependent variables depend on other variables.</div></div>
