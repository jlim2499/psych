<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A researcher is asked to explore the evidence base for a relatively new drug used in  Wernicke's Encephalopathy. They find a selection of studies following their literature search using PubMed. Which of the following studies that they identify constitutes the highest level of evidence?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">A prospective cohort study</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>A prospective cohort study</b>. In the hierarchy of evidence, prospective cohort studies are placed higher than case series, retrospective case-control studies, cross-sectional studies and nested case-control studies. This is because prospective cohort studies follow a group of similar individuals (cohorts) who differ with respect to certain factors under study, to determine how these factors affect rates of a certain outcome. They allow for studying multiple outcomes or exposures that were not identified at the start of the study. They also reduce potential bias in measurement of exposure and outcome variables because these are collected prior to the outcomes occurring.<br/><br/><b>A case-series</b> is lower on the evidence hierarchy as it involves description of characteristics of a group of patients with a particular condition or treatment but lacks a comparison group. Therefore, it does not provide strong empirical evidence due to potential confounding variables that have not been controlled for.<br/><br/><b>A retrospective case-control study</b> also provides less robust evidence than a prospective cohort study. It starts with an outcome then traces back to investigate exposures. It's prone to recall bias as it depends on participants' memory and records for past risk factors and behaviours. <br/><br/><b>A cross-sectional study</b> analyses data from a population at one specific point in time, providing a 'snapshot' view. Whilst useful for determining prevalence and correlational relationships, they can't establish causality or temporal sequence between exposure and outcome which makes them less reliable compared to prospective cohort studies.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>a nested case-control study</b> is within a larger cohort study where cases developing the outcome of interest are identified following initiation of the cohort and controls are selected from those who haven't developed the disease by the time cases occur. Although this design combines some advantages of both cohort and case control studies (such as efficiency), it still falls below prospective cohorts in terms of level of evidence as selection bias may be introduced during control selection and temporal sequence between exposure and outcome may not be clearly established.<br/></div>
