<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>In which of the following study design is one prone to draw an illogical conclusion that relationships which exist for groups are assumed to also be true for individuals?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Ecological study</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Ecological fallacy â†’ error of assuming that relationships observed at the group level apply to individuals within the group</div>The correct answer is <b>Ecological study</b>. This type of study is prone to what's known as an 'ecological fallacy', where relationships observed for groups are incorrectly assumed to also apply to individuals. For example, if a study found that countries with higher average fish consumption have lower rates of depression, it would be an ecological fallacy to conclude that any individual who eats more fish will have a lower risk of depression. The relationship at the group level does not necessarily hold true at the individual level.<br/><br/><b>Cohort studies</b> are longitudinal observational studies where two groups differing in outcome are identified and classified as exposed or unexposed to a certain factor. They follow these cohorts over time to see how their exposure affects the outcome. They aren't typically subject to the ecological fallacy because they track individual-level data.<br/><br/><b>Cross-sectional studies</b>, on the other hand, observe a defined population at a single point in time or over a short period. It examines the relationship between diseases (or other health-related characteristics) and other variables of interest in a specified population. However, they do not provide evidence of cause-and-effect relationships and usually do not involve making assumptions about individuals based on group data.<br/><br/>A <b>Non-randomised trial</b> is an experimental study where allocation into different intervention groups is not randomised. While this design can introduce bias since it doesn't ensure equal distribution of confounding factors across intervention groups, it doesn't inherently lead one to draw conclusions about individuals based on group data.<br/><br/>Lastly, a <b>Case series</b> is a descriptive study that follows patients with a known exposure given similar treatment or examines their medical records for outcomes. This type of study might identify possible associations between an exposure and outcome but cannot demonstrate causality and does not make assumptions about individuals based on group data.<br/><br/></div>
