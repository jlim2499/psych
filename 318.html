<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>An intervention improves a patient's QoL from 0.1 to 0.3 over a period of 5 years. What is the incremental QALY gained due to the intervention?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">1 QALY</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>1 QALY</b>. The incremental QALY (Quality-Adjusted Life Year) gained due to the intervention is calculated by multiplying the improvement in quality of life (0.3 - 0.1 = 0.2) by the duration of the intervention (5 years). Thus, 0.2 Ã— 5 = 1 QALY. This metric is critical in health economics to assess the cost-effectiveness of interventions by quantifying the quality and quantity of life added.<br/></div>
