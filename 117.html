<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A group of patients enrolled for a trial had a normal distribution for weight.  The mean weight was 90kg.  The standard deviation for this group was calculated to be 5kg.  What percentage of the patients in this study would you expect to weigh between 85 and 95kg?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">68.2%</span></div><br/>The SD is 5kg.<br/><br/>+/- 1SD = 68.2% = 85-95kg.<br/>+/- 2SD = 95.4% = 80-100kg.<br/>+/- 3SD = 99.7% = 75-105kg.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Correct Answer:<br/><br/>68.2% is the correct answer. To find the percentage of patients weighing between 85 and 95kg in a normally distributed population with a mean of 90kg and a standard deviation of 5kg, we use the properties of the normal distribution. Approximately 68.2% of the values lie within one standard deviation of the mean in a normal distribution, which in this case are the weights between 85kg (mean - 1 standard deviation) and 95kg (mean + 1 standard deviation).<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>95.4% would represent the percentage of patients within two standard deviations from the mean, which would be between 80kg and 100kg, not 85kg and 95kg.<br/><br/>72.4% does not correspond to a standard range of the normal distribution and therefore is incorrect.<br/><br/>99.7% would represent the percentage of patients within three standard deviations from the mean, which is not the range asked in the question.<br/><br/>90.5% is not a standard percentage related to the normal distribution for the range specified and is therefore incorrect.<br/><br/>The correct answer is based on the empirical rule, or 68-95-99.7 rule, which states that for a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean.<br/></div>
