You study your test in detail and find that it correlates highly with Becks which is considered the gold standard.  Your test has good<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Convergent validity </span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Convergent validity</b>. Convergent validity refers to the degree to which two measures of constructs that theoretically should be related, are in fact related. In this case, the new depression screening test and the Beck Depression Inventory (which is considered the gold standard) are both aiming to measure the same construct - depression. The high correlation between these two tests indicates that they are measuring the same underlying construct, hence demonstrating good convergent validity.<br/><br/><b>Face validity</b> is incorrect because it refers to whether a test appears (on its face) to measure what it's supposed to. It's about subjective judgement from the observer's perspective and does not involve any statistical or empirical evidence such as correlation with a gold standard. <br/><br/><b>External validity</b>, also incorrect, refers to how well the results of a study can be generalised or applied beyond its immediate context or population. In this scenario, there's no information given about generalising results so we cannot assume external validity.<br/><br/><b>Divergent validity</b>, another incorrect option, is when a test doesn't correlate with unrelated constructs. If your new depression screening test had good divergent validity, it would mean it doesn't correlate with measures of unrelated constructs like intelligence or physical fitness.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>Internal validity</b> is also not correct as it pertains to how well an experiment is conducted (particularly whether it avoids confounding), not how well a test correlates with another similar test. Internal validity ensures that any observed effects can be attributed solely to manipulation of independent variables and not due to confounding factors.<br/><br/></div>
