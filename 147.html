<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is an example of an interval scale?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Temperature in Celsius</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Temperature in Celsius</b>. An interval scale is a type of measurement scale that allows for the quantification of the difference between data points. However, it does not have a true zero point; this means that you cannot say something is 'twice as hot' based on the interval scale because 0 degrees does not mean there's no heat. The Celsius temperature scale is an example of an interval scale, where differences between temperatures are consistent, but 0 degrees does not represent an absence of temperature.<br/><br/><b>Council tax band</b> is incorrect as it represents an ordinal scale. An ordinal scale categorises data into distinct categories which can be ordered or ranked. In the case of council tax bands, properties are categorised into bands (A-H) according to their value, and these bands can be ranked from lowest (A) to highest (H).<br/><br/><b>Age in years</b> is also incorrect as it represents a ratio scale rather than an interval scale. A ratio scale has all the characteristics of an interval scale but also has a clear definition of zero. In terms of age, zero years signifies absence i.e., before birth or non-existence.<br/><br/><b>Height in cm</b> is another example of a ratio scale. It has a true zero point (i.e., absence of height), and differences and ratios between measurements are meaningful.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Gender</b> is incorrect as it represents a nominal variable which refers to categorical data without any order or priority. This includes variables such as gender, blood groups or types of diseases where each category is distinctly different with no implied order or rank.<br/><br/></div>
