<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>In a normal distribution what percentage of values lie within 3 standard deviations of the mean?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">99.7%</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>99.7%</b>. In a normal distribution, approximately 68% of values lie within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95% lie within two standard deviations, and around 99.7% fall within three standard deviations. This is often referred to as the empirical rule or the 68-95-99.7 rule in statistics.<br/><br/>The option <b>68.3%</b> would be correct if the question asked for the percentage of values that lie within one standard deviation from the mean, not three. In a normal distribution, this represents the data that falls between -1 and +1 standard deviations from the mean.<br/><br/>Option <b>98.3%</b> does not correspond to any specific range within a standard normal distribution curve and therefore is incorrect.<br/><br/>The choice <b>95.4%</b> is slightly off but seems to refer to the fact that approximately 95% of values in a normal distribution lie within two standard deviations of the mean (the actual figure being closer to 95.5%). However, it's not accurate for three standard deviations which was asked in this question.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>97.2%</b>, like option B, does not match with any specific known percentage related to standard deviations in a normal distribution curve and thus it's incorrect as well.<br/><br/></div>
