<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A researcher investigates the correlation between natural lithium levels in drinking water across different geographical regions and the regional rates of depression and suicide. What type of study design is this?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Ecological study</span></div><br/><i><b>Previous Exam Question</b></i><br/><br/>The correct answer is <b>Ecological study</b>. An ecological study examines the relationship between exposure and outcomes at the population or group level rather than the individual level. In this case, the study investigates the correlation between lithium levels in drinking water (exposure) and rates of depression and suicide (outcomes) across different geographical regions. These studies are useful for generating hypotheses but are limited by the ecological fallacy.<br/><br/><b>Case-control study</b>: This is incorrect. Case-control studies compare individuals with a specific outcome (cases) to those without the outcome (controls) to examine past exposures. This study does not focus on individual-level data.<br/><br/><b>Cross-sectional study</b>: This is incorrect. Cross-sectional studies collect data at a single point in time to assess both exposure and outcome prevalence in individuals. This question describes a population-level analysis rather than individual data.<br/><br/><b>Cohort study</b>: This is incorrect. Cohort studies follow a group of individuals over time to examine the relationship between exposures and outcomes. This study does not involve tracking individuals longitudinally.<br/><br/><b>Randomised controlled trial</b>: This is incorrect. Randomised controlled trials involve random allocation of participants to intervention and control groups to assess causal effects. This study is observational and does not involve interventions.<br/></div>
