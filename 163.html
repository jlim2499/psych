The median is the most appropriate measure of central tendency for summarising data that is skewed or has outliers. In the provided histogram, the data is positively skewed, meaning that the majority of individuals have lower body mass with a tail extending towards higher body mass values. The median is less affected by extreme values compared to the mean and provides a better central value representation in such cases.<br/><br/><b>Mode</b> refers to the most frequently occurring value in the dataset. While the mode can be useful in understanding the most common body mass, it does not effectively summarise the central tendency of a skewed distribution as it does not account for the spread of the other data points.<br/><br/><b>Variance</b> measures the dispersion of the data points from the mean, not the central tendency. It indicates how much the body mass values vary but does not provide a central value to summarise the dataset.<br/><br/><b>Mean</b> is the arithmetic average of all the data points. While it is a commonly used measure of central tendency, it is highly sensitive to outliers and skewed data. In this histogram, the skewness would pull the mean towards the higher body mass values, making it less representative of the central tendency compared to the median.<br/><br/><b>Interquartile range</b> measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data but does not provide a single value to summarise the central tendency. It is useful for understanding data dispersion and identifying outliers but is not a measure of central tendency itself.<br/></div>
