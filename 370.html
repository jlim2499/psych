<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is true of correlation?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Complete absence of correlation is expressed by a value of 0</span></div><br/>The correct answer is: <b>Complete absence of correlation is expressed by a value of 0</b>. In statistical terms, correlation measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. A correlation coefficient of 0 indicates no linear relationship between the variables. This means that changes in one variable do not predict or affect changes in the other.<br/><br/>Discussing the incorrect answers:<br/><br/><b>Complete correlation between two variables is expressed by either +10 or -10</b>: This statement is incorrect because the range for a correlation coefficient lies between -1 and +1. A positive value signifies a direct linear relationship (as one variable increases, so does the other), while a negative value signifies an inverse linear relationship (as one variable increases, the other decreases). A value of +1 or -1 indicates perfect positive or negative correlation respectively, not +10 or -10.<br/><br/><b>Correlation can take any value between 0-10</b>: As mentioned above, this statement is also incorrect. The possible values for a correlation coefficient range from -1 to +1, not 0 to 10.<br/><br/><b>Negative correlation disproves causation</b>: This statement is misleading. Correlation does not imply causation irrespective of whether it's positive, negative or zero. While a negative correlation suggests an inverse relationship between two variables, it does not provide evidence that changes in one variable cause changes in another.<br/><br/><b>The terms correlation and regression are synonymous</b>: This statement is false as well. Correlation and regression are both statistical techniques used in data analysis but they serve different purposes and have distinct interpretations. Correlation measures the degree to which two variables move in relation to each other, whereas regression provides a way to predict one variable based on another.<br/><br/></div>
