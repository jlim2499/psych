The standard deviation of the sample is 6mmol/L and the sample size is 9.  The standard error of the mean is 2mmol/L.  Which of the following is the closest approximation for the correct range for the 95% confidence interval?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">3-11 mmol/L</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>3-11 mmol/L</b>. To determine the 95% confidence interval for the mean, we use the following formula:<br/><br/>Confidence Interval = μ ± (Z × SE)<br/><br/>Where:<br/><br/>μ is the sample mean<br/>Z is the Z-score for a 95% confidence interval (which is 1.96)<br/>SE is the standard error of the mean<br/>Given:<br/><br/>μ = 7 mmol/L<br/>SE = 2 mmol/L<br/>The 95% confidence interval is calculated as:<br/><br/>7 ± (1.96 × 2)<br/><br/>7 ± 3.92<br/><br/>Lower bound = 7 - 3.92 = 3.08<br/><br/>Upper bound = 7 + 3.92 = 10.92<br/><br/>Rounding to the nearest whole number, the range is approximately 3 to 11 mmol/L.<br/><br/><b>-5-19 mmol/L</b> is incorrect. This range is too wide and unrealistic given the data provided.<br/><br/><b>1-13 mmol/L</b> is incorrect. This range is slightly too wide and does not match the correct calculation.<br/><br/><b>5-9 mmol/L</b> is incorrect. This range is too narrow and does not cover the 95% confidence interval based on the given standard error.<br/><br/><b>1-7 mmol/L</b> is incorrect. This range does not correctly reflect the mean and the standard error provided.<br/></div>
