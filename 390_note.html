Certain study types are recognised as being better for certain questions. This is illustrated in the table below.<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid1"><thead><tr><th>Type of question</th><th>Best type of studies</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Therapy</td><td>Randomized controlled trial (RCT), cohort, case control, case series</td></tr><tr><td>Diagnosis</td><td>Cohort studies* with comparison to gold standard test</td></tr><tr><td>Prognosis</td><td>Cohort studies, case control, case series</td></tr><tr><td>Etiology/Harm</td><td>RCT, cohort studies, case control, case series</td></tr><tr><td>Prevention</td><td>RCT, cohort studies, case control, case series</td></tr><tr><td>Cost</td><td>Economic analysis</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/><i>Note: For diagnostic studies, cross-sectional studies can be appropriate, but cohort studies are often preferred, especially when the new diagnostic test needs to be compared to the gold standard over a period. Cross-sectional studies are commonly used to assess the accuracy of a diagnostic test because they measure the exposure and outcome simultaneously in a population at a single point in time. However, cohort studies provide a more robust comparison as they can follow patients over time and compare the outcomes of a new test against the gold standard, providing a clearer picture of the test's diagnostic accuracy in a real-world setting.</i><br/><br/>There are two main types of study design each with their own subtypes.<br/><br/>1) Experimental (where an intervention is used)<br/><br/><ul><li>Randomised trial</li><li>Non-randomised trial</li><li>Case study</li><li>Case series</li></ul><br/>2) Observational (no intervention, observation only)<br/><br/><ul><li>Cohort study</li><li>Case-control study</li><li>Cross-sectional study</li><li>Ecological (correlational) study</li><li>Case series</li></ul><br/><i>Note that case studies and case-series can be both experimental and observational.</i><br/><br/><b>Randomised Control Trials</b><br/><br/>An experimental comparison study in which participants are allocated to treatment/intervention or control/placebo groups using a random mechanism.  Best for study the effect of an intervention.<br/><br/><b>Cohort Study</b><br/><br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mma125.png"/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/>Cohort studies can be retrospective or prospective (see below).<br/><br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mma127.png"/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/>In a prospective cohort study a study population WITHOUT disease is separated into cohorts which differ by exposure to a risk factor. These cohorts are then followed up to see if disease / an outcome occurs.  This enables calculation of the relative risk.<br/><br/>Risk factors can be binary (e.g. diabetic yes / no) or continuous (e.g. serum phosphate level).<br/><br/>A retrospective cohort study is quicker to perform and less costly than a prospective one. In this type of cohort study, the data are collected from records. Thus, the outcomes have occurred in the past. Even though the outcomes have occurred in the past, the basic study design is essentially the same. Thus, the investigator starts with the exposure and other variables at baseline and at follow-up and then measures the outcome during the follow-up period.<br/><br/><b>Case-control study</b><br/><br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mma126.png"/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/>Patients with a certain outcome or disease and an appropriate group of controls without the outcome or disease are selected (usually with careful consideration of appropriate choice of controls, matching, etc) and then information is collected retrospectively on whether the subjects have been exposed to the factor under investigation.<br/><br/><i>Note: a variation of this is the nested case-control study which is the same but draws cases and controls from an existing cohort.</i><br/><br/><b>Cross-Sectional Survey</b><br/><br/>A study that examines the relationship between diseases (or other health-related characteristics) and other variables of interest as they exist in a defined population at one particular time (ie exposure and outcomes are both measured at the same time). Best for quantifying the prevalence of a disease or risk factor, and for quantifying the accuracy of a diagnostic test.<br/><br/><b>Ecological study</b><br/><br/>Ecological studies consider where and when diseases are occurring in populations. The presence / absence of specific risk factors is not related to individuals with or without disease, but rather to populations.  Ecological studies are often considered to be weak study types as they cannot prove anything, however they are used to raise questions for further research.<br/><br/>The table below lists the major types of studies along with their key advantages and disadvantages.<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid2"><thead><tr><th>Study type</th><th>Advantages</th><th>Disadvantages</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Randomised Controlled Trial</td><td>- Unbiased distribution of confounders<br/>- Blinding more likely<br/>- Randomisation facilitates statistical analysis</td><td>- Expensive<br/>- Time consuming<br/>- Volunteer bias<br/>- Ethically problematic at times</td></tr><tr><td>Cohort Study</td><td>- Ethically safe<br/>- Subjects can be matched<br/>- Can establish timing and directionality of events<br/>- Eligibility criteria and outcome assessments can be standardised<br/>- Administratively easier and cheaper than RCT</td><td>- Controls may be difficult to identify<br/>- Exposure may be linked to a hidden confounder<br/>- Blinding is difficult<br/>- Randomisation not present<br/>- For rare disease, large sample sizes or long follow-up necessary</td></tr><tr><td>Case-Control Study</td><td>- Quick and cheap<br/>- Only feasible method for very rare disorders or those with long lag between exposure and outcome<br/>- Fewer subjects needed than cross-sectional studies</td><td>- Reliance on recall or records to determine exposure status<br/>- Confounders<br/>- Selection of control groups is difficult<br/>- Potential bias: recall, selection</td></tr><tr><td>Cross-Sectional Survey</td><td>- Cheap and simple<br/>- Ethically safe</td><td>- Establishes association at most, not causality<br/>- Recall bias susceptibility<br/>- Confounders may be unequally distributed<br/>- Neyman bias<br/>- Group sizes may be unequal</td></tr><tr><td>Ecological study</td><td>- Cheap and simple<br/>- Ethically safe</td><td>- Ecological fallacy (when relationships which exist for groups are assumed to also be true for individuals)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div>
