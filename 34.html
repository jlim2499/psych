In the context of hypothesis testing, the alternative or research hypothesis is a statement that suggests a potential outcome that the researcher may expect. It's typically contrary to the null hypothesis and reflects the possibility of statistically significant findings. The research hypothesis is usually denoted as H1.<br/><br/>Discussing the other options:<br/><br/>The term <b>Statistical hypothesis</b> can be misleading. While it's true that hypotheses are used in statistical analyses, there isn't a specific 'statistical' hypothesis. Hypotheses in statistics are generally divided into null and alternative (or research) hypotheses.<br/><br/><b>Simple hypothesis</b> is also not correct. A simple hypothesis refers to a specific type of statistical inference where there's only one parameter being tested for statistical significance. This contrasts with composite hypotheses which test multiple parameters simultaneously. However, neither of these terms directly refer to what an alternative hypothesis is called.<br/><br/>The <b>Null hypothesis</b>, often denoted as H0, is actually the opposite of the alternative or research hypothesis. It asserts that no difference or effect exists in the population; any observed difference in samples is due to chance or sampling error.<br/><br/>Lastly, a <b>Composite hypothesis</b> tests for more than one parameter at once and contrasts with a simple hypothesis as mentioned earlier. But again, it doesn't define what an alternative or research hypothesis is called.<br/><br/></div>
