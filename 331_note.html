The most commonly encountered effect measures used in clinical trials with dichotomous data are:<br/><br/><ul><li>the odds ratio (OR)</li><li>the risk ratio (RR) (also called the relative risk)</li><li>the risk difference (RD) (also called the absolute risk reduction)</li><li>the number needed to treat (NNT)</li></ul><br/><b>Risks versus odds</b><br/><br/>To understand the difference between the odds ratio and relative risk it is crucial that you understand the difference between risks and odds.<br/><br/>Risk:<br/><br/><ul><li>Risk is a proportion</li><li>Risk describes the probability with which a health outcome (usually an adverse event) will occur.</li><li>Commonly expressed as a decimal number between 0 and 1, although it is occasionally converted into a percentage</li><li>Often expressed as a number of individuals per 1000</li><li>When the risk is 0.1, in a sample of 100 people the number of events observed will on average be 10</li><li>When the risk is 0.5, about 50 people out of every 100 will have the event</li></ul><br/>Odds:<br/><br/><ul><li>Odds is a ratio</li><li>The odds is the ratio of the probability that a particular event will occur to the probability that it will not occur</li><li>Can be any number between zero and infinity</li><li>In health care it is the ratio of the number of people with the event to the number without</li><li>Commonly expressed as a ratio of two integers.

In many studies it will just be the incidence rate. In an experimental study it will just be the number of events in that group (intervention or placebo) divided by the number of people in that group.<br/><br/>In the 2x2 table below the absolute risk of remission in the olanzapine intervention is 60/100 (or 60%).<br/><br/>Once you know the absolute risks in each group then you can subtract one from the other to get the risk difference or divide one by the other to get the relative risk.<br/><br/>Risk difference:<br/><br/>The absolute risk reduction (also termed risk difference or the attributable risk) is the difference between the absolute risk of an event in the intervention group and the absolute risk in the control group. The term attributable risk is discouraged as it implies causation (which you will recall is not appropriate for studies such as cohort and case-control which can only go so far as to suggest association).<br/><br/>When working with treatment effects such as absolute and relative risk it is helpful to construct a 2x2 table as follows<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid1"><thead><tr><th></th><th>Outcome present</th><th>Outcome absent</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Intervention / exposed</td><td>a</td><td>b</td><td>EER = a / (a + b)</td></tr><tr><td>Control / not exposed</td><td>c</td><td>d</td><td>CER = c / (c + d)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>Absolute risk reduction (ARR) is given by the following formula<br/><br/>ARR = CER - EER<br/><br/>For example, if we look at a trial comparing the use of olanzapine for psychosis compared to placebo we get the following results.<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid2"><thead><tr><th></th><th>Achieved remission (outcome present)</th><th>Did not achieve remission (outcome absent)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Olanzapine (intervention)</td><td>(a) 60</td><td>(b) 40</td></tr><tr><td>Placebo (control)</td><td>(c) 20</td><td>(d) 60</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>ARR = CER - EER <br/><br/>EER = a / (a + b)<br/>        = 60 / 100<br/>        =  0.6<br/><br/>CER = c / (c + d)<br/>        =20 / 80 <br/>        = 0.25<br/><br/>ARR = CER - EER<br/>        = 0.25 - 0.6 <br/>        = -0.35 (you can ignore the minus sign as we are interested in the absolute difference)<br/>        = 35%<br/><br/>The absolute risk reduction of 35% means that there was a risk difference of 35% between the two groups. Another way of stating this is that there were 35% more remissions in the olanzapine group when compared to the placebo.<br/><br/>Relative risk:<br/><br/><ul><li>Relative risk (RR) is the ratio of risk in the intervention (experimental) group to the risk in the control group (a ratio of the two absolute risks)</li><li> A value of 1 indicates that the estimated effects are the same for both interventions</li><li>Used in cohort, cross-sectional and randomised control trials (not case-control)</li></ul><br/>RR = EER / CER<br/><br/>EER = rate at which events occur in the experimental group<br/>CER = rate at which events occur in the control group<br/><br/>For example, if we look at the same trial <br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid3"><thead><tr><th></th><th>Achieved remission (outcome present)</th><th>Did not achieve remission (outcome absent)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Olanzapine (intervention)</td><td>(a) 60</td><td>(b) 40</td></tr><tr><td>Placebo (control)</td><td>(c) 20</td><td>(d) 60</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>RR = EER / CER<br/><br/>EER = a / (a + b)<br/>        = 60 / 100<br/>        =  0.6<br/><br/>CER = c / (c + d)<br/>        =20 / 80 <br/>        = 0.25<br/><br/>RR = EER / CER <br/>      = 0.6 / 0.25 <br/>      = 2.4<br/><br/>Interpretation of relative risk:<br/><br/>A value of 1 indicates that the estimated effects are the same for both interventions.<br/><br/>A risk ratio of 3 for a treatment implies that events with treatment are three times more likely than events without treatment.<br/><br/>A relative risk of 2.4 means that patients in the intervention group were 2.4 times more likely to achieve remission than those who received a placebo.<br/><br/>If the risk ratio is &gt; 1 then the rate of an event (in this case experiencing significant pain relief) is increased compared to controls. It is therefore appropriate to calculate the relative risk increase if necessary (see below).<br/><br/>If the risk ratio is &lt; 1 then the rate of an event is decreased compared to controls. The relative risk reduction should therefore be calculated (see below).<br/><br/>Relative risk reduction:<br/><br/>The relative risk reduction (RRR) is the proportion by which the intervention reduces the event rate.<br/><br/>Relative risk reduction (RRR) or relative risk increase (RRI) is calculated by dividing the absolute risk reduction (risk difference) by the control event rate<br/><br/>RRR = ARR / CER<br/>RRR = (CER - EER) / CER<br/><br/>Using the above data <br/><br/>RRI = (CER - EER) / CER = (0.6 - 0.25) / 0.25 = 1.4 = 140%<br/><br/>Numbers needed to treat:<br/><br/>The number needed to treat (NNT) is the number of patients who need to treated for one to get benefit.<br/><br/>The ARR is the reciprocal of the NNT and vice versa <br/><br/>ARR = 1 / NNT<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>NNT = 1 / ARR<br/><br/>For example, using the same trial<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid4"><thead><tr><th></th><th>Achieved remission (outcome present)</th><th>Did not achieve remission (outcome absent)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Olanzapine (intervention)</td><td>(a) 60</td><td>(b) 40</td></tr><tr><td>Placebo (control)</td><td>(c) 20</td><td>(d) 60</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>The ARR = 0.35<br/><br/>The NNT = 1 / ARR<br/>              = 1 / 0.35<br/>              = 2.9 (1 dp)<br/><br/><b>Odds measures</b><br/><br/>Odds are calculated by dividing the number of times an event happens by the number of times is does not happen.<br/><br/>For example...<br/><br/>If 2 in every 100 patients treated with an antipsychotic have a seizure then the odds of developing a seizure if given an antipsychotic is 2/98 = 0.0204<br/><br/><i>Note: this is different to the risk which is the probability that an event will happen divided by those at risk. In this case 2/100 = 0.02.</i><br/>Odds ratio:<br/><br/><ul><li>The odds ratio is the odds of an outcome given a particular exposure versus the odds of an outcome in the absence of the exposure</li><li>Most commonly used in case-control studies, however they can also be used in cross-sectional and cohort study designs as well (with some modifications and/or assumptions).</li></ul><br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mma134.png"/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/>Odds ratio (OR) = (a/b) / (c/d)<br/><br/>An odds ratio of 1 indicates no difference in risk between the two groups.<br/><br/>If the odds ratio &gt;1 then the rate of that event is increased in people exposed to that risk factor.<br/><br/>If the odds ratio &lt;1 then the rate of that event is reduced in people exposed to that risk factor.<br/><br/>Odds ratios are the usual reported measure in case-control studies. It approximates to relative risk if the outcome of interest is rare.<br/><br/>For example, let's look at a trial comparing the use of paracetamol for headache compared to placebo.  The outcome is a significant reduction (&gt; 50%) in pain. The exposure of interest is paracetamol use. Of 60 patients with a headache who take paracetamol, 40 achieve significant pain reduction. Of the 90 who take the placebo, 30 achieve significant pain reduction.<br/><br/><i>Note: by convention always list the exposure on the left of the 2x2 table and outcome at the top.</i><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid5"><thead><tr><th></th><th>Significant pain reduction</th><th>No significant pain reduction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Paracetamol</td><td>40</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Placebo</td><td>30</td><td>60</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>The odds of achieving significant pain relief with paracetamol = 40 / 20 = 2<br/><br/>The odds of achieving significant pain relief with placebo = 30 / 60 = 0.5<br/><br/>Therefore the odds ratio = 2 / 0.5 = 4<br/><br/>This is interpreted as - the odds of significant pain relief from paracetamol use are 4 times those from placebo.</div></div>
