<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which statement is true regarding qualitative data?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">It is non-numerical and categorical in nature</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>It is non-numerical and categorical in nature</b>. Qualitative data consists of non-numerical information that represents categories or attributes rather than measurable quantities. In clinical psychiatry, examples include a patient's diagnosis (e.g. bipolar disorder), risk status (e.g. low, medium, high), or marital status (e.g. single, divorced). These are best understood as categorical variables, which may be nominal (no inherent order) or ordinal (with a natural order). Recognising qualitative data is vital for selecting appropriate methods of data collection and analysis, such as thematic analysis in qualitative research, or chi-squared testing for group differences in audits.<br/><br/><b>It is numerical and continuous</b> is incorrect because this describes a subtype of quantitative data. Continuous data can take any value within a range (e.g. BMI, age) and are fundamentally different from the non-numerical nature of qualitative variables.<br/><br/><b>It is always ordinal</b> is incorrect as not all qualitative data has an inherent order. While some qualitative variables like symptom severity ('mild', 'moderate', 'severe') are ordinal, many others, such as a patientâ€™s diagnosis or ethnicity, are nominal and cannot be logically ordered.<br/><br/><b>It cannot be coded for analysis</b> is incorrect. In practice, qualitative data is frequently coded for analysis. For example, themes from clinical interviews or focus groups may be categorised for content analysis. In electronic health records, free-text entries can be coded into structured data for audit and service development.<br/><br/><b>It measures quantities</b> is incorrect because qualitative data captures qualities or categories, not quantities. Measuring quantities is a characteristic of quantitative data. Misidentifying qualitative data as quantitative could lead to inappropriate use of statistical methods and flawed interpretation in clinical audit or research settings.<br/></div>
