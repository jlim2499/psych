<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following terms is used to refer to a placebo which when administered results in unpleasant side-effects due to the negative expectations held by the patient?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">A nocebo</span></div><br/>Active placebos cause unpleasant effects by design (i.e they are not completely inert). When the side-effects result from patient related factors (such as negative expectations) then this is a nocebo effect.<br/><br/>The correct answer is <b>B nocebo</b>. The term 'nocebo' is used to describe a placebo that causes adverse side effects due to the patient's negative expectations or beliefs. It comes from the Latin word 'I will harm'. This phenomenon is part of the psychological response where negative anticipation or belief about a treatment leads to harmful outcomes, despite the substance or treatment being inactive or harmless itself.<br/><br/><b>A enhanced placebo</b> is incorrect as it refers to a placebo with added features designed to enhance its perceived effectiveness, not induce negative effects. Typically, this could be modifications in size, colour, taste, method of delivery (e.g., injection instead of tablet) which are believed by patients to have more therapeutic effect.<br/><br/><b>A placebo substitute</b> also doesn't fit the definition. This term generally refers to an inactive substance given as a replacement for a real drug in clinical trials. These substitutes are used when it would be unethical or impractical to withhold treatment from a control group in such studies.<br/><br/>The option <b>An active placebo</b> is not correct either. Active placebos are substances that mimic certain side effects of the medication being studied in a trial without having any therapeutic effect. They're often used in trials for medications with noticeable side effects to help maintain blinding and prevent participants from guessing whether they're on the active medication or not based on presence or absence of these side effects.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>A non-specific placebo</b> isn't accurate as well. Non-specific typically refers to treatments that don't target any particular disease mechanism but might still have some general beneficial effect (like pain relief). However, this term isnâ€™t commonly used in medical literature and may cause confusion.<br/><br/></div>
