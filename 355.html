<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A randomised controlled trial is performed to look at a new drug to prevent Alzheimer's disease in people with a positive family history. Group A consists of 1,000 people who take the new drug whilst group B contains 1,400 people taking a placebo. The Alzheimer's rate in group A is 2% and in group B is 4%. What is the number needed to treat to prevent one case of Alzheimer's?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">50</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">NNT = 1 / ARR</div>The correct answer is <b>50</b>. The number needed to treat (NNT) is a measure of the effectiveness of a health-care intervention, typically a treatment with medication. It represents the number of patients that need to be treated in order to prevent one additional bad outcome (or ensure one additional good outcome). In this case, it refers to how many people need to take the new drug in order to prevent one case of Alzheimer's disease. <br/><br/>To calculate NNT, we first need to find out the absolute risk reduction (ARR). ARR is calculated as the absolute difference between the control event rate and the experimental event rate. Here, the control group (group B) has an Alzheimer's rate of 4%, whilst the experimental group (group A) has an Alzheimer's rate of 2%. Therefore, ARR = 4% - 2% = 2%. <br/><br/>The formula for NNT is then 1/ARR. Since ARR is given as a percentage, it should be converted into decimal form before calculation, so 2% becomes 0.02. Hence NNT = 1/0.02 = 50.<br/><br/>Now let's discuss why other options are incorrect.<br/><br/><b>10</b>: This would imply an ARR of 10%, which isn't correct according to our calculations.<br/><br/><b>6</b>: Similarly, this would indicate an ARR of approximately 16.67%, which doesn't match with our findings.<br/><br/><b>12</b>: This option suggests an ARR around 8.33%, again not aligning with our computed value.<br/><br/><b>2</b>: This would mean that for every two people treated with the new drug, one case of Alzheimer's is prevented which implies an extremely high efficacy that isn't supported by our data since it corresponds to an ARR of 50%.<br/><br/>In conclusion, understanding how to calculate and interpret NNT can be crucial in evaluating the effectiveness of a new treatment or intervention.<br/></div>
