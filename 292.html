<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Two hundred hypertensive patients on clozapine are randomised into two groups: one group (96 patients) participates in a diet programme, and the other group (104 patients) participates in an exercise programme. Blood pressure is measured for each patient both before and three months after the start of their respective programme. The aim is to determine if the mean change in blood pressure (difference between after and before measurements) is significantly different between the two programmes. The data is continuous and normally distributed. Which statistical test is most appropriate to evaluate this?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Two sample t-test</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Two sample t-test</b>. This is the most appropriate statistical test for comparing the mean change in a continuous, normally distributed variable (in this case, blood pressure) between two independent groups. Each patient has paired before-and-after measurements, but the statistical comparison is between the mean of these change scores in the diet group and the exercise group.<br/><br/>In this study:<br/><br/>Group 1 (n=96): Diet programme<br/><br/>Group 2 (n=104): Exercise programme<br/><br/>Outcome: Change in blood pressure = (Post-intervention â€“ Pre-intervention)<br/><br/>Data: Continuous and normally distributed<br/><br/>Since the two groups are independent (patients are not the same across groups), and the comparison is of mean change, a two sample t-test is the correct choice.<br/><br/><b>Paired t-test</b> is incorrect. A paired t-test is used when comparing two related measures within the same group, for example, pre- and post-intervention blood pressure in one group only. While each patient in this study has a before-and-after value, the analysis is not comparing within each individual or within a single group, it's comparing the difference in change between two independent groups. Therefore, the paired structure of the measurements within subjects is already accounted for by calculating the change score, and the comparison is now between independent groups.<br/><br/>Many learners are tempted to choose the paired t-test here because they see that each subject is measured twice. However, once the change score is calculated (i.e., the delta between pre- and post-treatment), that score becomes a single, independent value for each participant. At that point, you're comparing the average of these values between two independent groups, which is why a two sample t-test is correct.<br/><br/><b>ANOVA</b> is also incorrect. Although it is used to compare means across more than two groups, this study only involves two groups (diet and exercise). A one-way ANOVA could technically be used for two groups, but it is less efficient and offers no additional benefit over a two sample t-test in this case.<br/><br/>Some users may wonder whether this is a repeated-measures design, requiring repeated measures ANOVA, since there are pre- and post-intervention measurements. That would only be correct if you were modelling the interaction between time and group, or comparing within- and between-group effects over time. However, this question specifies that the outcome is the change score, and thus does not require repeated-measures ANOVA.<br/><br/><b>Chi-squared test</b> is inappropriate here because it is used for comparing categorical data, such as frequencies or proportions. In this case, the outcome is continuous (blood pressure), making chi-squared testing invalid.<br/><br/><b>Kruskal-Wallis test</b> is a non-parametric alternative to ANOVA and is used when comparing more than two groups with non-normally distributed data. Since the question states that the data is normally distributed and there are only two groups, the Kruskal-Wallis test is not appropriate.<br/></div>
