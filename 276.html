<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is true regarding the mean?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Is sensitive to a change in any value in the data set</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Is sensitive to a change in any value in the data set</b>. The mean, also known as the arithmetic average, is calculated by adding all values in a data set and dividing by the number of values. Therefore, if any single value changes, it will affect the overall sum and hence the mean. This makes it sensitive to every value in the dataset.<br/><br/>Moving on to the incorrect answers:<br/><br/><b>Is the most frequent value in a data set</b>. This statement describes not the mean, but instead refers to the mode. The mode is defined as the most frequently occurring value within a dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or several modes (multimodal).<br/><br/><b>Is calculated by arranging the data set in numerical order and selecting the middle value.</b> This statement incorrectly defines mean; it actually describes how to determine median. The median is found by arranging all values from least to greatest and choosing the middle one. If there are an even number of observations, then median is calculated by taking an average of two middle numbers.<br/><br/><b>Is synonymous with the median</b>. This statement is incorrect because while both are measures of central tendency, they are calculated differently and may yield different results especially when dealing with skewed distributions or outliers.<br/><br/><b>Is less sensitive to outliers than the mode</b>. This statement is incorrect; actually, mean is more sensitive to outliers than either mode or median. An outlier can greatly influence the sum of all values in a dataset, which directly affects calculation of mean but does not impact determination of mode or median as drastically.<br/></div>
