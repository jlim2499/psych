The use of levels is often illustrated as a hierarchy with systematic reviews at the top and expert opinion or non-analytical studies at the bottom.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there are a lot of different classification systems which creates inconsistencies (particularly with regard to questions in your exam). Internet forums frequently discuss this topic with some claiming one thing and others another.<br/><br/><b>Hierarchy approach</b><br/><br/>Traditional hierarchies simply placed systematic reviews or randomised control trials at the top and case-series/report at the bottom.<br/><br/>Traditional hierarchy:<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid1"><thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>Type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs with definitive results</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>RCTs with definitive results (confidence intervals that do not overlap the threshold clinically significant effect)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>RCTs with non-definitive results (a point estimate that suggests a clinically significant effect but with confidence intervals overlapping the threshold for this effect)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Cohort studies</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Case-control studies</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Cross sectional surveys</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Case reports</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>These type of hierarchies are useful as a rule of thumb but are overly simplistic.<br/><br/>This situation is more complicated as certain research questions cannot be answered using RCTs. This means that in certain situations the highest level of evidence may be another type of study such as a cohort study.<br/><br/>In an attempt to address this the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine introduced their 2011 Levels of Evidence system. This system separates the type of study questions and gives a hierarchy for each.<br/><br/><b>Grading approach</b><br/><br/>The main grading approach to be aware of is the GRADE system.<br/><br/>The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach for review questions about interventions has been used in the development of NICE clinical guidelines since 2009 (it is used by many other institutions as well).<br/><br/>GRADE was developed by an international working group for rating the quality of evidence in systematic reviews and guidelines. It is now being used to grade the quality of primary research also.<br/><br/>The quality of evidence is classified as high, moderate, low or very low<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid2"><thead><tr><th>Grade</th><th>description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>High</td><td>further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect</td></tr><tr><td>Moderate</td><td>further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate</td></tr><tr><td>Very low</td><td>any estimate of effect is very uncertain</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>The process begins by formulating a study question and so identifying specific outcomes. Outcomes are then graded as critical or important (but not critical to a decision).<br/><br/>The evidence is then gathered and criteria are used to grade the evidence:<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid3"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Type of evidence</td><td><ul><li>Randomised trial = high</li><li>Observational study = low</li><li>Any other evidence = very low</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Decrease grade if</td><td><ul><li>Serious (- 1) or very serious (- 2) limitation to study quality</li><li>Important inconsistency (- 1)</li><li>Some (- 1) or major (- 2) uncertainty about directness</li><li>Imprecise or sparse data (- 1)</li><li>High probability of reporting bias (- 1)</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Increase grade if</td><td><ul><li>Strong evidence of association significant relative risk of &gt; 2 (&lt; 0.5) based on consistent evidence from two or more observational studies, with no plausible confounders (+1)</li><li>Very strong evidence of association significant relative risk of &gt; 5 (&lt; 0.2) based on direct evidence with no major threats to validity (+2)</li><li>Evidence of a dose response gradient (+1)</li><li>All plausible confounders would have reduced the effect (+1)</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>Note that evidence can be promoted or downgraded. This builds in the facility to promote observational studies to high quality evidence under the right circumstances.</div></div>
