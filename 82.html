<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>The total number of people who have a disease over a particular time span can be summarised by which of the following?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Period prevalence</span></div><br/><b><i>Previous Exam Question</i></b><br/><br/>The correct answer is <b>Period prevalence</b>. Period prevalence refers to the proportion of a population that has a specific disease or condition over a certain time period. This includes both existing cases at the start of the period and new cases that develop during that time. It provides information on the total disease burden in a population over a specified period. <br/><br/><b>Predictive prevalence</b> is not a recognised term in epidemiology, hence it is incorrect. It can be confused with predictive value, which refers to the probability that individuals with a positive test truly have the disease.<br/><br/><b>Point prevalence</b> refers to the proportion of individuals in a population who have a particular disease or attribute at one specific point in time. This contrasts with period prevalence, which considers disease occurrence over an extended timeframe.<br/><br/><b>Lifetime prevalence</b>, while similar to period prevalence, differs by considering an individual's entire lifespan rather than a specific time frame. It measures the proportion of people who have ever had the disease during their lifetime up until the point of assessment.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>Standardised prevalence</b> is not an accurate term in epidemiology either. It might be confused with standardised incidence ratio (SIR), which is used to compare incidence rates across different populations or periods by adjusting for age and other confounding factors. Therefore, this option is also incorrect as it does not summarise the total number of people who have had a disease over a particular time span.<br/></div>
