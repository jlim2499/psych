<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A new test to screen for borderline personality disorder (BPD) is used in 100 patients who present to their GP with thoughts to self-harm. The test is positive in 30 of the 40 patients who are proven to have BPD. Of the remaining 60 patients, only 5 have a positive test. What is the sensitivity of the new test?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">75%</span></div><br/>A contingency table can be constructed from the above data, as shown below:<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid1"><thead><tr><th></th><th>BPD present</th><th>BPD absent</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Test positive</td><td>30</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Test negative</td><td>10</td><td>55</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>75%</b>. Sensitivity of a test refers to its ability to correctly identify those with the disease. It is calculated as the number of true positives (those with the disease who test positive) divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives (those with the disease who test negative). In this case, there are 30 true positives (patients with BPD who tested positive) and 10 false negatives (patients with BPD who tested negative), so the sensitivity is 30 / (30+10) = 0.75 or 75%.<br/><br/>The option <b>8.33%</b> might have been chosen if one incorrectly calculated sensitivity as the number of true positives divided by the total population size, which is not correct.<br/><br/>The option <b>30%</b> might have been selected if one considered only the number of patients who tested positive without taking into account whether they truly had BPD or not, which does not give an accurate measure of sensitivity.<br/><br/>The option <b>40%</b> could be chosen if one misinterpreted the question and thought it was asking for prevalence rate of BPD in this sample, which is not what's being asked.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>66.66%</b> could have been selected if one miscalculated by dividing true positives by all patients who didn't have BPD. This would actually be calculating specificity, not sensitivity.<br/></div>
