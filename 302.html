<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A psychiatrist has noted that male patients with adult ADHD seen in clinic seem to be smaller than expected. They attempt to estimate the average height of males with ADHD by taking a sample of 200 patients.<br/>They find the mean height to be 174 cm with a variance of 27 cm². The median height is 170 cm. The range of the sample is 152 - 198 cm.<br/><br/>From the following, select the standard deviation of the sample.<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">5.2</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>5.2</b>. The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. It can be calculated by taking the square root of the variance. In this case, the variance given is 27 cm² and hence, the standard deviation would be √27 which equals approximately 5.2.<br/></div>
