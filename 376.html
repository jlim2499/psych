A study is designed where a margin is defined (-delta to +delta) on mean reduction of PANSS score. If the confidence interval of the difference between the new drug and olanzapine lies within this margin then the trial can be said to have produced a positive result. What is this an example of?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Equivalence trial</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Equivalence trial</b>. In an equivalence trial, the goal is to demonstrate that the new antipsychotic is neither significantly worse nor significantly better than the standard treatment (olanzapine), within a defined margin (-delta to +delta) for the PANSS score. The trial aims to show that the two treatments are clinically similar in terms of efficacy, which is useful when a new treatment might offer other benefits such as fewer side effects, lower costs, or better patient compliance. Clinically, this can help expand treatment options without compromising efficacy, ensuring patients receive equally effective alternatives.<br/><br/><b>Non-inferiority trial</b> focuses on showing that the new treatment is not unacceptably worse than the standard. Only the lower bound of the confidence interval needs to be above the predefined margin, whereas equivalence trials require the entire confidence interval to be within the margin. This trial design is often used when the goal is to introduce a treatment that might offer practical benefits despite having similar or slightly reduced efficacy.<br/><br/><b>Superiority trial</b> seeks to prove that the new treatment is better than the standard treatment. This type of trial is not relevant here as the study design aims to demonstrate equivalence, not superiority. Superiority trials are more resource-intensive and may not always be the most appropriate choice when introducing a treatment expected to have similar efficacy.<br/><br/><b>Placebo-controlled trial</b> compares the new drug against a placebo, which is not applicable here because the comparison is being made against a known effective treatment (olanzapine). Ethically, placebo-controlled trials are often unsuitable in cases where there is an established effective treatment for the condition, as withholding such a treatment can put patients at risk.<br/><br/><b>Delta-controlled trial</b> is not a standard term in clinical trial designs. It may refer to trials that define a margin (delta) to determine efficacy but lacks the formal definition and structure seen in equivalence or non-inferiority trials. In this scenario, the trial is focused on equivalence, making this option incorrect.<br/></div>
