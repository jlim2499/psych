Case-control studies often depend on participants' ability to remember past exposures or events. Since the study subjects may not remember past exposures accurately and because cases may remember exposures more clearly than controls due to their disease status, case-control studies are particularly prone to recall bias.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Participation bias: While participation bias can affect case-control studies, it is not as characteristic of them as recall bias. Participation bias occurs when there is a systematic difference between those who choose to participate in the study and those who do not.<br/><br/>Publication bias: This type of bias refers to the selective publication of positive findings and is not specific to case-control studies. It affects the body of research literature as a whole.<br/><br/>Expectation bias: This type of bias can affect any study design and occurs when a researcher's expectations influence the outcomes. It is not specific to case-control studies.<br/><br/>Loss to follow-up bias: This bias typically affects cohort studies more than case-control studies, as it involves participants dropping out of the study over time, which is less of an issue in case-control studies that look at conditions and exposures retrospectively.<br/></div>
