<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which one of the following statements best describes a type I error?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">The null hypothesis is rejected when it is true</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Type I error = rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true</div>The correct answer is <b>The null hypothesis is rejected when it is true</b>. In statistical hypothesis testing, a type I error occurs when the null hypothesis (H0) is true, but it's incorrectly rejected. It's equivalent to a false positive result as we are accepting an effect or relationship that doesn't actually exist in the population.<br/><br/><b>The null hypothesis is accepted when it is false</b> describes a type II error, not a type I error. A type II error occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis even though it's false. This means that there really is an effect or relationship in the population, but our study failed to detect it.<br/><br/><b>The p value fails to reach statistical significance</b> isn't describing any type of error. Rather, this statement refers to a situation where the evidence isn't strong enough to reject the null hypothesis. If our p-value is greater than our significance level (usually 0.05), then we fail to reject H0 and conclude that our data do not provide enough evidence for H1.<br/><br/><b>The alternative hypothesis is rejected when it is true</b> also describes a Type II error just like 'The null hypothesis is accepted when it is false'. Here, there truly exists a difference or effect in the population but due to limitations of sample size or variability, we fail to detect this difference and incorrectly reject the alternative hypothesis.<br/><br/><b>A study fails to reach an appropriate power</b> refers to an issue with statistical power, which isn't directly related with type I errors. Statistical power refers to the probability that your test will find a statistically significant result when an effect actually exists. If you have low power, you're less likely to detect an effect if one truly exists - leading potentially towards a Type II error rather than Type I.<br/><br/></div>
