The box plot for the group with anxiety disorder shows that the median is closer to the upper quartile, and there is a longer tail on the left side, indicating a left (negative) skewness. This means that the majority of the scores are higher, but there are a few lower scores that pull the mean to the left. Clinically, recognising a negatively skewed distribution is important as it suggests that while most patients with anxiety disorder score higher on the GHQ, there is a significant subset with much lower scores, indicating less severe symptoms which may require less intensive intervention.<br/><br/><b>Irregular</b> is not the correct answer. The term 'irregular' implies a distribution without any discernible pattern or shape, which is not accurate for this box plot. The plot shows a specific pattern of skewness rather than a lack of structure.<br/><br/><b>Skewed right</b> is incorrect. A right-skewed (positively skewed) distribution would have the median closer to the lower quartile and a longer tail on the right side, indicating that most scores are lower with a few higher scores. This does not match the distribution seen in the box plot for anxiety disorder.<br/><br/><b>Bell shaped</b> is also incorrect. A bell-shaped distribution, or normal distribution, would have the median in the centre, with symmetrical tails on both sides. The box plot for anxiety disorder does not exhibit this symmetry and balance.<br/><br/><b>Bimodal</b> is not accurate either. A bimodal distribution would show two distinct peaks or modes in the data. The box plot for anxiety disorder shows a single peak and a left-skewed distribution, indicating a different pattern of data concentration.<br/></div>
