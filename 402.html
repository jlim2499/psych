<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following poses the most significant threat to the external validity of a study?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Representativeness of the sample</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Representativeness of the sample</b>. External validity refers to the extent to which the results of a study can be generalised or applied to other contexts, populations, settings or times. If a sample is not representative of the population it's intended to represent, then the findings of the study may not be applicable beyond that specific sample. This poses a significant threat to external validity.<br/><br/><b>Instrument obtrusiveness</b> refers to how much an instrument (like a questionnaire or test) interferes with the natural behaviour of participants in a study. While this can affect how participants respond and therefore impact the internal validity of a study, it does not directly affect external validity unless it somehow influences who chooses to participate in the study.<br/><br/><b>Experimental mortality</b>, or attrition bias, refers to participants dropping out of a study before it ends. This can threaten both internal and external validity if those who drop out differ systematically from those who remain in terms of characteristics related to the outcome. However, while this could potentially limit generalisability if dropout rates are high and differential, it is generally less impactful on external validity than issues with sample representativeness.<br/><br/><b>Maturation</b> involves changes that occur naturally over time within individuals who are participating in a study. These changes can affect internal validity if they are mistaken for effects caused by an intervention being studied. However, maturation effects do not inherently threaten external validity unless they lead to systematic differences between those who complete and those who do not complete follow-up assessments.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Measurement sensitisation</b> occurs when repeated measurements influence participants' responses. For instance, participants might become more skilled at completing tasks due to practice effects or might alter their behaviour because they are aware they are being observed (the Hawthorne effect). Like instrument obtrusiveness, measurement sensitisation primarily threatens internal rather than external validity, unless it influences who agrees to participate or continue participating in a study.<br/></div>
