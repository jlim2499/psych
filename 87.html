A cohort study is a type of observational study design where two or more groups (cohorts) are identified and followed over time to observe the outcomes. The cohorts are often classified based on their exposure to certain factors, and the incidence of outcome in these groups is then compared. This type of research design is always observational as the researchers do not intervene but rather observe the natural progression of events.<br/><br/><b>Case study</b> can be an observational or an experimental study depending on its application. In a case study, detailed information about a single individual or a small group is collected and analysed. It can be used both for exploratory purposes (as an observational study) or for testing specific interventions (as an experimental study).<br/><br/>A <b>Randomised controlled trial (RCT)</b> is not an observational study but rather an interventional one. In RCTs, participants are randomly assigned to either the intervention group receiving the treatment under investigation or to a control group receiving standard care or placebo. The outcomes in these groups are then compared to determine the effectiveness of the intervention.<br/><br/>Similarly, <b>Non-randomised controlled trial</b> also falls under experimental studies and not observational ones. In this type of trial, participants are not randomly assigned to intervention and control groups which may introduce certain biases into the results.<br/><br/>Lastly, a <b>Case series</b>, like case studies, can be either observational or experimental depending upon its usage. A case series collects and analyses data from multiple similar cases together in order to understand common patterns and characteristics. If it's used purely for descriptive purposes without any manipulation by researchers, it's considered as observational; however if used for assessing interventions it becomes experimental.<br/><br/></div>
