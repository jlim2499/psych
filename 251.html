This formula is used to determine how much a negative test result decreases the probability of having a disease. It involves subtracting the sensitivity (the true positive rate) from one and then dividing by the specificity (the true negative rate). <br/><br/>The option <b>Specificity / (sensitivity - 1)</b> is incorrect because it does not provide an accurate calculation for the likelihood ratio of a negative test result. Sensitivity, which represents the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease, cannot be subtracted from 1 in this context as it would give a value that doesn't represent any known epidemiological measure.<br/><br/><b>Sensitivity / (1 - specificity)</b> also provides an incorrect calculation. This formula is actually used to calculate the likelihood ratio for a positive test result, not a negative one. The likelihood ratio for a positive result tells us how much a positive test increases the probability of having the disease.<br/><br/>The fourth option, <b>(Sensitivity -1) / (specificity - 1)</b>, does not correspond to any known formula used in evidence-based medicine or epidemiology. Both sensitivity and specificity are measures that range between 0 and 1; subtracting 1 from either value would lead to negative values, which do not make sense in this context.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Specificity / (1 - sensitivity)</b> is also incorrect. While it contains elements of both sensitivity and specificity, this arrangement does not yield an accurate calculation for either the likelihood ratio of a positive or negative result.<br/></div>
