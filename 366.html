<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A psychiatrist is reviewing an ADHD assessment tool and wants to determine if it reliably measures the same construct each time it is used with the same individual, assuming no changes in symptoms. Which type of reliability would be most appropriate to assess?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Test-retest reliability</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Test-retest reliability</b>. Test-retest reliability assesses the stability of a measure over time by administering the same test to the same individual on two different occasions. If the ADHD assessment tool is reliable, it should yield consistent results on repeated administrations when the individual's symptoms remain unchanged. This form of reliability is essential for ensuring that any observed changes are due to actual changes in symptoms rather than inconsistencies in the assessment tool itself.<br/><br/><b>Split-half reliability</b>: Split-half reliability assesses the internal consistency of a test by dividing it into two halves and comparing the results of each half. While this method ensures consistency within the test items, it does not address the stability of the tool over time, making it unsuitable for determining consistency across repeated administrations.<br/><br/><b>Parallel-forms reliability</b>: Parallel-forms reliability involves administering two equivalent forms of a test to the same group and comparing results. This form of reliability is valuable for avoiding practice effects but is not relevant here, as the question focuses on consistency over time using the same tool rather than equivalent forms.<br/><br/><b>Internal consistency reliability</b>: Internal consistency reliability measures how consistently items within a test measure the same construct, often using statistical methods like Cronbach's alpha. While useful for evaluating the consistency of items within a single administration, it does not assess stability over time, making it unsuitable for this scenario.<br/><br/><b>Inter-rater reliability</b>: Inter-rater reliability assesses the consistency of scores when different raters or observers administer the test. This form of reliability is critical in situations where multiple clinicians assess the same patient, but it is not relevant to determining whether the tool yields stable results for the same individual across repeated administrations.<br/></div>
