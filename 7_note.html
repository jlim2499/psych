They tend to remit spontaneously after a few weeks to months.<br/><br/><b>Diagnosis (Somatoform)</b><br/><br/>ICD-11 lists two main types of somatoform disorders:<br/><br/><ul><li>Bodily distress disorder</li><li>Body integrity dysphoria</li></ul><br/>Disorders of bodily distress and bodily experience are characterised by disturbances in the person's experience of his or her body. Bodily distress disorder involves bodily symptoms that the individual finds distressing and to which excessive attention is directed. Body integrity dysphoria involves a disturbance in the person's experience of the body manifested by the persistent desire to have a specific physical disability accompanied by persistent discomfort, or intense feelings of inappropriateness concerning current non-disabled body configuration.<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid1"><thead><tr><th>Manual</th><th>Essential Features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ICD-11</td><td>Bodily distress disorder<br/><br/>The presence of bodily symptoms that are distressing to the individual. Typically, this involves multiple bodily symptoms that may vary over time. Occasionally the focus is limited to a single symptom, usually pain or fatigue.<br/><br/>Excessive attention is directed toward the symptoms, which may manifest in:<br/><br/>- Persistent preoccupation with the severity of the symptoms or their negative consequences. In individuals who have an established medical condition that may be causing or contributing to the symptoms, the degree of attention related to the symptoms is clearly excessive in relation to the nature and severity of the medical condition.<br/><br/>- Repeated contacts with health care providers related to the bodily symptoms that are substantially in excess of what would be considered medically necessary.<br/><br/>Excessive attention to the bodily symptoms persists despite appropriate clinical examination and investigations or appropriate reassurance by health care providers.<br/><br/>Bodily symptoms are persistent; that is, some symptoms are present (though not necessarily the same symptoms) on most days during a period of at least several months (e.g., 3 months or more).<br/><br/>The bodily symptoms and related distress and preoccupation result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.<br/><br/>The symptoms or the associated distress and preoccupation are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia or Other Primary Psychotic Disorder, a Mood Disorder, or an Anxiety or Fear-Related Disorder).</td></tr><tr><td>ICD-11</td><td>Body integrity dysphoria<br/><br/>An intense and persistent desire to become physically disabled in a significant way (e.g., a major limb amputation, paraplegia, blindness) accompanied by persistent discomfort or intense negative feelings about one's current body configuration or functioning.<br/><br/>The desire to be disabled results in harmful consequences, manifested by either or both of the following:<br/>Attempts to actually become disabled through self-injury have resulted in the person putting their health or life in significant jeopardy.<br/><br/>Preoccupation with the desire to be disabled results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (e.g., avoidance of close relationships, interference with work productivity).<br/><br/>Onset of the persistent desire to be disabled occurs by early adolescence.<br/><br/>The disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia or Other Primary Psychotic Disorder, in which, for example, a delusional conviction that the limb belongs to another person may be present, Factitious Disorder) or by Malingering.<br/><br/>The symptoms or behaviours are not better accounted for by Gender Incongruence, by a Disease of the Nervous System, or by another medical condition.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/><b>Key differentiators</b><br/><br/>Factitious disorder:<br/><br/>Individuals with Body Integrity Disorder often simulate their desired disability as a way of reducing their negative feelings (e.g., a person who desires to be paraplegic may spend part or all of their time using a wheelchair). Moreover, they typically shun medical attention. In contrast, individuals with Factitious Disorder feign medical or psychological signs or symptoms in order to seek attention, especially from health providers and to assume the sick role. Malingering is characterized by feigning of medical or psychological signs or symptoms for obvious external incentives (e.g., disability payments).<br/><br/>Dermatitis artefacta (Saha, 2015) is a rare self-induced psychocutaneous disorder seen in factitious disorder where the patient denies his/her role in its causation. Mechanical and chemical devices are most commonly used to produce such injuries. Laboratory investigations, including histopathological examination, are usually nonspecific and do not give a correct clue to diagnosis.<br/><br/>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder:<br/><br/>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is characterized by repetitive and persistent thoughts, images, or urges that are experienced as intrusive and unwanted (ego-dystonic). In contrast, the repetitive thoughts, images, and impulses related the desire to become disabled in Body Integrity Dysphoria (e.g., fantasies of being disabled) are ego-syntonic and are not experienced as intrusive, unwanted or distressing. Distress in Body Integrity Dysphoria is typically related to not being able to actualize the disability or to fear of the negative judgments of others.<br/><br/>Body dysmorphic disorder:<br/><br/>Individuals with Body Dysmorphic Disorder have persistent preoccupations about a part of their body that they believe is defective or that their appearance overall is ugly. In contrast, individuals with Body Integrity Dysphoria are persistently preoccupied with a sense that the way their body is configured (e.g., for those who desire an amputation) or functions (e.g., for those who want to be paraplegic or blind) is wrong, unnatural, and not as it should be.<br/><br/>Hypochondriasis:<br/><br/>Hypochondriasis is coded under obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.<br/><br/>Bodily Distress Disorder is characterized by the presence of bodily symptoms that are distressing to the individual and to which excessive attention is directed, such as dwelling on the severity of the symptoms and repeatedly visiting health care providers. While some individuals with Hypochondriasis may experience bodily symptoms that cause distress and for which they may seek medical attention, their main concern in doing so is the fear that the symptoms are indicative of having a serious, progressive or life-threatening illness. In contrast, individuals with Bodily Distress Disorder are typically preoccupied with the bodily symptoms themselves and the impact they have on their lives, and while they may seek out health care providers who can determine the cause of their symptoms, they do so in order to get relief from the symptoms, not to disconfirm the belief that they have a serious medical illness.<br/><br/><b>Diagnosis (Dissociative disorders)</b><br/><br/>Dissociative disorders are characterised by involuntary disruption or discontinuity in the normal integration of one or more of the following: identity, sensations, perceptions, affects, thoughts, memories, control over bodily movements, or behaviour. Disruption or discontinuity may be complete, but is more commonly partial, and can vary from day to day or even from hour to hour.<br/><br/>ICD-11 dissociative disorders include:<br/><br/><ul><li>Dissociative Neurological Symptom Disorder</li><li>Dissociative Amnesia</li><li>Trance Disorder</li><li>Possession Trance Disorder</li><li>Dissociative Identity Disorder</li><li>Partial Dissociative Identity Disorder</li><li>Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder</li><li>Other Specified Dissociative Disorders</li></ul><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid2"><thead><tr><th>Manual</th><th>Disorder</th><th>Essential features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ICD-11</td><td>Dissociative neurological symptom disorder</td><td>Involuntary disruption or discontinuity in the normal integration of motor, sensory, or cognitive functions, lasting at least several hours.<br/><br/>Clinical findings are not consistent with a recognized Disease of the Nervous System (e.g., a stroke) or another medical condition (e.g., a head injury).<br/><br/>The symptoms do not occur exclusively during episodes of Trance Disorder, Possession Trance Disorder, Dissociative Identity Disorder, or Partial Dissociative Identity Disorder.<br/><br/>The symptoms are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects, do not occur exclusively during hypnagogic or hypnopompic states, and are not due to a Sleep-Wake disorder (e.g., Sleep-Related Rhythmic Movement Disorder, Recurrent isolated sleep paralysis).<br/><br/>The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia or Other Primary Psychotic Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder).<br/><br/>The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.</td></tr><tr><td>ICD-11</td><td>Dissociative amnesia</td><td>Inability to recall important autobiographical memories, typically of recent traumatic or stressful events, that is inconsistent with ordinary forgetting.<br/><br/>The memory loss does not occur exclusively during episodes of Trance Disorder, Possession Trance Disorder, Dissociative Identity Disorder, or Partial Dissociative Identity Disorder and is not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g., Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, a Neurocognitive Disorder such as Dementia).<br/><br/>The symptoms are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g., alcohol), including withdrawal effects, and are not due to a Disease of the Nervous System (e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy), another medical condition (e.g., a brain tumour) or to head trauma.<br/><br/>The memory loss results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.</td></tr><tr><td>ICD-11</td><td>Trance disorder</td><td>Occurrence of a trance state in which there is a marked alteration in the individual's state of consciousness or a loss of the individual's normal sense of personal identity, characterized by both of the following:<br/><br/> - Narrowing of awareness of immediate surroundings or unusually narrow and selective focusing on specific environmental stimuli; and<br/><br/>- Restriction of movements, postures, and speech to repetition of a small repertoire that is experienced as being outside of one's control.<br/><br/>The trance state is not characterized by the experience of being replaced by an alternate identity.<br/><br/>Trance episodes are recurrent or, if the diagnosis is based on a single episode, the episode has lasted for at least several days.<br/><br/>The trance state is involuntary and unwanted and is not accepted as a part of a collective cultural or religious practice.<br/>The symptoms are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (including withdrawal effects), exhaustion, or to hypnagogic or hypnopompic states, and are not due to a Disease of the Nervous System (e.g., complex partial seizures), head trauma, or a Sleep-Wake Disorder.<br/><br/>The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort.</td></tr><tr><td>ICD-11</td><td>Possession trance disorder</td><td>Occurrence of a trance state in which there is a marked alteration in the individual's state of consciousness and the individual's normal sense of personal identity is replaced by an external 'possessing' identity. The trance state is characterized by behaviours or movements that are experienced as being controlled by the possessing agent.<br/><br/>Trance episodes are attributed to the influence of an external 'possessing' spirit, power, deity or other spiritual entity.<br/>Trance episodes are recurrent or, if the diagnosis is based on a single episode, the episode has lasted for at least several days.<br/><br/>The possession trance state is involuntary and unwanted and is not accepted as a part of a collective cultural or religious practice.<br/><br/>The symptoms are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (including withdrawal effects), exhaustion, or to hypnagogic or hypnopompic states, and are not due to a Disease of the Nervous System (e.g., complex partial seizures) or a Sleep-Wake Disorder.<br/><br/>The symptoms result in significant distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort.</td></tr><tr><td>ICD-11</td><td>Dissociative identity disorder</td><td>Disruption of identity characterized by the presence of two or more distinct personality states (dissociative identities), involving marked discontinuities in the sense of self and agency. Each personality state includes its own pattern of experiencing, perceiving, conceiving, and relating to self, the body, and the environment.<br/><br/>At least two distinct personality states recurrently take executive control of the individual's consciousness and functioning in interacting with others or with the environment, such as in the performance of specific aspects of daily life (e.g., parenting, work), or in response to specific situations (e.g., those that are perceived as threatening).<br/>Changes in personality state are accompanied by related alterations in sensation, perception, affect, cognition, memory, motor control, and behaviour. There are typically episodes of amnesia inconsistent with ordinary forgetting, which may be severe.<br/><br/>The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia or Other Primary Psychotic Disorder).<br/><br/>The symptoms are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects (e.g., blackouts or chaotic behaviour during substance intoxication), and are not due to a Disease of the Nervous System (e.g., complex partial seizures) or to a Sleep-Wake disorder (e.g., symptoms occur during hypnagogic or hypnopompic states).<br/><br/>The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort.</td></tr><tr><td>ICD-11</td><td>Partial dissociative identity disorder</td><td>Disruption of identity characterized by the experience of two or more distinct personality states (dissociative identities), involving discontinuities in the sense of self and agency. Each personality state includes its own pattern of experiencing, perceiving, conceiving, and relating to self, the body, and the environment.<br/><br/>One personality state is dominant and functions in daily life (e.g., parenting, work), but is intruded upon by one or more non-dominant personality states (dissociative intrusions). These intrusions may be cognitive (intruding thoughts), affective (intruding affects such as fear, anger, or shame), perceptual (e.g., intruding voices fleeting visual perceptions, sensations such as being touched), motor (e.g., involuntary movements of an arm), or behavioural (e.g., an action that lacks a sense of agency or ownership). These experiences are experienced as interfering with the functioning of the dominant personality state and are typically aversive.<br/><br/>The non-dominant personality states do not recurrently take executive control of the individual's consciousness and functioning to the extent that they perform in specific aspects of daily life (e.g., parenting, work). However, there may be occasional, limited and transient episodes in which a distinct personality state assumes executive control to engage in circumscribed behaviours (e.g., in response to extreme emotional states or during episodes of self-harm or the reenactment of traumatic memories).<br/><br/>The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia or Other Primary Psychotic Disorder).<br/><br/>The symptoms are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects (e.g., blackouts or chaotic behaviour during substance intoxication), and are not due to a Disease of the Nervous System (e.g., complex partial seizures) or to a Sleep-Wake disorder (e.g., symptoms occur during hypnagogic or hypnopompic states).<br/><br/>The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort.</td></tr><tr><td>ICD-11</td><td>Depersonalization-derealization disorder</td><td>Persistent or recurrent experiences of either or both depersonalization or derealization:<br/><br/>-Depersonalization is characterized by experiencing the self as strange or unreal, or feeling detached from, or as though one were an outside observer of, one's thoughts, feelings, sensations, body, or actions. Depersonalization may take the form of emotional and/or physical numbing, a sense of watching oneself from a distance or 'being in a play', or perceptual alterations (e.g., a distorted sense of time).<br/><br/>-Derealization is characterized by experiencing other persons, objects, or the world as strange or unreal (e.g., dreamlike, distant, foggy, lifeless, colourless, or visually distorted) or feeling detached from one's surroundings.<br/><br/>During experiences of depersonalization or derealization, reality testing remains intact. The experiences are not associated with delusions or beliefs that the individual is being controlled by external persons or forces.<br/><br/>The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g., Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, an Anxiety or Fear-Related Disorder, another Dissociative Disorder, Personality Disorder).<br/><br/>The symptoms are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects, and are not due to a Disease of the Nervous System (e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy), head trauma, or another medical condition.<br/><br/>The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>References:<br/><br/><i>Maggio (2020) Briquet syndrome revisited: implications for functional neurological disorder.
