<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Regarding the PICO model used in evidence based medicine, what does the C in PICO stand for?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Comparison</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Comparison</b>. In the PICO model used in evidence-based medicine, the 'C' stands for Comparison. This refers to the alternative intervention that you would like to compare with the intervention of interest. It could be a different treatment, no treatment or placebo.<br/><br/>The option <b>Cohort</b> is incorrect as it is a type of observational study design and does not fit into the PICO model. A cohort study follows a group of similar individuals (cohorts) who differ with respect to certain factors under study, to determine how these factors affect rates of a certain outcome.<br/><br/><b>Citation</b> is also an incorrect choice. While citations are important in referencing sources in medical literature, they do not form part of the PICO model which is specifically designed for structuring research questions in evidence-based practice.<br/><br/>The third incorrect option is <b>Case-control</b>. Similar to cohort, case-control refers to a type of observational study where two existing groups differing in outcome are identified and compared on the basis of some supposed causal attribute. This does not align with any components of PICO.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>Collection</b> does not fit within the PICO framework either. In a research context, collection often refers to data collection which although integral to any research process, isn't represented by 'C' in PICO. <br/><br/>Therefore, only Comparison accurately represents what 'C' stands for in the PICO model used for formulating answerable clinical questions in evidence-based medicine.<br/></div>
