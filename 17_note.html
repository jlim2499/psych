More commonly however the non-epileptic seizure results from mental or emotional processes in which case it is referred to as a dissociative seizure (previously termed 'pseudo seizure' or 'functional seizures').<br/><br/><i>Note: Dissociative seizure are not the same as factitious seizures, which are voluntary.</i> <br/>Dissociative seizures can consist of a fall (usually safe), a gesticulation (or, on the contrary, a frozen posture), pseudo-clonus of the limbs, ocular revulsion with or without eye blinking, or simply an eye closure with a subsequent non-responsive attitude.<br/><br/>Dissociative seizures are more common in females and tend to have an onset in late adolescence.<br/><br/>The following features are helpful when trying to distinguish between true seizures and pseudo seizures (Mellers, 2005):<br/><br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><a class="fancybox" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb099b.png" rel="group"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb099.png"/></a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"><a class="fancybox lbmagglasslink" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb099b.png" rel="group"><img src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/>Serum prolactin rises to concentrations greater than 500 IU/ml in over 90% of patients after a tonic-clonic seizure and 60% of patients after a complex partial seizure. Simple partial seizures are not followed by a rise in serum prolactin and prolactin concentrations may be normal after prolonged status epilepticus. Blood must be taken between 20 and 30 minutes after the seizure and compared with a baseline sample. The test is, however, used less and less in specialist centres as false positive results have now been found in syncope and dissociative seizures (Mellers, 2005).<br/><br/>TREATMENT:<br/><br/>A 2014 Cochrane Review on psychological and behavioural treatments concluded that there is little reliable evidence to support the use of any treatment, including cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), for psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.<br/><br/>Although data are limited, it is noteworthy that CBT is the only psychotherapeutic intervention studied as a treatment for psychogenic nonepileptic seizures in randomized controlled trials and, as a result, has the highest level of efficacy evidence (Kim, 2018).<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/><i>Mellers (2005) The approach to patients with ''non-epileptic seizures''.
