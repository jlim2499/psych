Possible indications are changes in speed, coherence, and cogency of thought.<br/><br/>A lack of an adequate connection between two consecutive thoughts is called 'asyndesis'.<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid1"><thead><tr><th>Term</th><th>S/O*</th><th>Definition</th><th>Comments / examples</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Inhibited Thinking</td><td>S</td><td>The thinking process is subjectively experienced by the patient as being slowed down or blocked (as by an inner wall of resistance).</td><td>The patient manages to overcome the obstruction hampering the thinking process with great trouble and effort only, or experiences their thinking processes as sluggish, torpid, and hard to initiate.</td></tr><tr><td>Retarded Thinking</td><td>O</td><td>The flow of thought processes is slowed down and sluggish.</td><td>Continuous delays in expressing thoughts obstruct the flow of conversation. Increased response latency is in evidence throughout.<br/>Note: inhibited thinking is about the subjective experience whereas retarded thinking is about the observed quality of thought as inferred through speech.</td></tr><tr><td>Circumstantial Thinking</td><td>O</td><td>An inability to separate the essential from the unessential during a conversation without, however, rendering the conversation incoherent.</td><td>The patient becomes lost in unimportant details and remains fixed on them without, however, losing track of their conversational aim. Such verbosity/long-windedness obstructs the examination process.</td></tr><tr><td>Restricted Thinking</td><td>O</td><td>Limited range of thought content, fixation on one particular topic or a small number of topics only. Fixation on a small number of objectives only. Stereotyped pattern of thinking.</td><td>In conversation, the patient experiences difficulty switching from one topic to another, or consistently returns to a given topic on repeated occasions. During examination, different topics must be introduced into the conversation. This is important since whilst the topic of ill health represents a central topic of the examination interview, a frequent return to it in conversation must not automatically be construed as a manifestation of restricted thinking. In the context of the topic of ill health, restricted thinking is present only where the patient remains fixated on particular aspects of the topic from which they can only be distracted with great difficulty, if at all (e.g., a depressive patient who remains fixated on the topic of disorder-related digestive problems).</td></tr><tr><td>Perseverative Thinking</td><td>O</td><td>Persistent repetition of previously used words, phrases, or details to the point where they become meaningless in the context of the current stage of the interview.</td><td>A patient may, for example, correctly identify a key as 'key' but subsequently uses the word 'key' persistently when asked to say their name or identify other objects.</td></tr><tr><td>Rumination</td><td>S</td><td>Endless mental preoccupation with, or excessive concern over, mostly unpleasant thoughts.</td><td>The patient reports that their thoughts continually and endlessly revolve around the same concerns and that the cycle can be broken with great difficulty only. The patient experiences these ruminations as uncomfortable or distressing.</td></tr><tr><td>Pressured Thinking (aka crowding of thought)</td><td>S</td><td>The patient feels helplessly exposed to the pressures of floods of different ideas or thoughts.</td><td>The patient feels unable to stay in control of or mentally sort the flood of constantly new ideas or thoughts. These thoughts may be sensible or nonsensical, seemingly tumbling over one another, or occur as if automated. The patient's thought processes do not necessarily appear accelerated to the outside observer.</td></tr><tr><td>Flight of Ideas</td><td>O</td><td>An increasing multitude of thoughts and ideas which, however, are no longer firmly guided by clear goal-directed thinking. As a result of diverse associations, thinking goals change frequently or become lost.</td><td>Patients suffering from flight of ideas become lost, flustered, and confused, and often fail to develop a thought to its conclusion as the train of thought is constantly interrupted by interfering new ideas. The distractions which interrupt clear, goal-oriented thinking may stem from external interference (e.g., background noises) or be based on various mental associations. The thinking processes of a patient suffering from flight of ideas are not necessarily accelerated.<br/><br/>Prolixity refers to a marginal variety of flight of ideas seen in hypomania where clang and verbal associations are less frequent, there is a general direction of thought and it is not as rapid.</td></tr><tr><td>Tangential Thinking</td><td>O</td><td>The patient appears to understand the contents of the questions addressed to them but provides answers which are completely out of context ('Vorbeireden' or 'talking past the point').</td><td>The deciding factor in the assessment of this symptom is not the fact that the answer is incorrect (as, e.g., in a school exam) but that the patient completely misses the point of the question by talking past or around it.<br/>An example of a patient talking past or around the point would be: 'Why did you come to the clinic yesterday?' - 'The Chinese Wall is over 5,000 km long.' - 'Do you remember what I asked you?' - 'Yes, you wanted to know why I came to the clinic yesterday.'</td></tr><tr><td>Thought Blocking/Disruption of Thought</td><td>Thought blocking = O<br/>Disruption of thought = S</td><td>Sudden disruption of an otherwise normal flow of thought or speech for no obvious reason.</td><td>The patient hesitates in mid-sentence, falls silent, then tries to re-start the conversation on possibly an entirely different topic. The interviewer may observe this phenomenon as 'blocking' (O), or the patient may report a 'disruption of thought'</td></tr><tr><td>Incoherence/Derailment</td><td>O</td><td>The interviewer is unable to establish sensible connections between the patient's thinking and verbal output, which is sometimes also called derailment. In extreme cases, what remains is a seemingly arbitrary tumble of fragmented sentences, phrases, and thoughts.</td><td>'Yesterday afternoon I came to the clinic because there's an election next year and the baker's only opens at 8.00 in the morning.' (paralogia) 'In the past, people consisted of blue-eyed humans and how the brains work.' 'I met this girl who couldn't show herself in any other way than they all generally took everything. It was meant so, and it had to be called: leave our guv'nor merry in the belly. True joy is a girl and a bloke all warped together and the two of them seeking eternal salvation in their fortune.' (schizophasia)</td></tr><tr><td>Neologisms</td><td>O</td><td>The formation of new words, or usage of words, which disregard normal conventions and are generally not easily understandable.</td><td>Following an EEG examination, a patient reports that: 'Yesterday, I had to have a diagraph and my head was being totally demachronised.'</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/><i>* S = subjective / O = objective</i></div></div>
