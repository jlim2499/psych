<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>The PICO model used in evidence based medicine is designed to assist which of the following?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Formulating answerable questions</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Formulating answerable questions</b>. The PICO model stands for Patient/Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome. It is a method used to frame and answer clinical questions in evidence-based medicine. This model helps healthcare professionals formulate researchable, specific and relevant questions by focusing on the patient's problem or condition (P), the intervention being considered (I), a comparison intervention if applicable (C) and the outcome(s) of interest (O).<br/><br/><b>Evaluating systematic reviews</b> is not the correct answer as the PICO model does not directly evaluate systematic reviews. Systematic reviews are a type of literature review that collects and critically analyzes multiple research studies or papers. While PICO can be used to guide the search strategy within a systematic review, it does not evaluate the quality or findings of these reviews.<br/><br/><b>Establishing the presence of publication bias</b> is also incorrect. Publication bias occurs when the outcome of an experiment or research study influences the decision whether to publish or otherwise distribute it. The PICO model does not have any components that specifically address this issue.<br/><br/>The option <b>Limiting the Hawthorne effect</b> is also incorrect. The Hawthorne effect refers to individuals modifying an aspect of their behaviour in response to their awareness of being observed. While designing robust studies may take into account observer effects like this, it is not a direct function of using the PICO model.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Selecting the appropriate study design</b> is not correct either. While defining your question clearly using PICO might indirectly help you think about what kind of study would best answer your question, choosing an appropriate study design involves considerations beyond those included in formulating a question with PICO such as resources available, ethical considerations, feasibility and so on.<br/><br/></div>
