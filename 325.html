<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>What is the median value from the following data set 2, 9, 4, 1, 23?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">4</span></div><br/>To find the median, we must first order the data set from lowest to highest values. For the given data set 2, 9, 4, 1, 23, the ordered set is 1, 2, 4, 9, 23. The median is the middle number in the ordered sequence of numbers.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Correct Answer:<br/><br/>4 is the correct answer. In an ordered set of five numbers, the median is the third number, which is the middle value in the sequence. Here, that number is 4.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>7.8 is not a value in the data set and cannot be the median.<br/><br/>2 is a value in the data set but is not the middle value when the data is ordered.<br/><br/>1 is the lowest value in the data set, not the median.<br/><br/>9 is a value in the data set but is not the middle value when the data is ordered. It is the second to the last value when ordered.<br/><br/>The median is a conceptually straightforward measure of central tendency that does not require calculation beyond ordering the values and finding the central one, making option 4 the correct answer.<br/></div>
