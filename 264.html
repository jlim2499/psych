This however is a question from the exam and if you come across it we suggest you select funnel plot as the correct answer as it is the most commonly used.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Correct Answer:<br/><br/>Funnel plot: A funnel plot is specifically designed to detect publication bias in meta-analyses. It plots the effect sizes from individual studies against a measure of study size or precision. In the absence of publication bias, the graph should resemble a symmetrical inverted funnel. Deviations from this shape can indicate potential publication bias, with smaller studies showing larger treatment effects often being underrepresented if they have non-significant findings.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Forest plot: A forest plot is used in meta-analyses to show the estimates of effect from several scientific studies on the same treatment or intervention, presenting individual study results and the overall meta-analysis result. It does not specifically allow for the detection of publication bias.<br/><br/>Box plot: A box plot is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five-number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. It is not used to detect publication bias.<br/><br/>Stem and Leaf Plot: A stem and leaf plot is a method of presenting quantitative data in a graphical format, similar to a histogram, to assist in visualizing the distribution of the data. It is not used for detecting publication bias.<br/><br/>Galbraith plot: A Galbraith plot can be used to detect heterogeneity in meta-analyses or to identify outlier studies but is less commonly used for assessing publication bias compared to funnel plots.<br/></div>
