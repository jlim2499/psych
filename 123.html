<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>What is the median value from the following data set?<br/>1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 90<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">3.5</span></div><br/>The median is the value at which half the values are below and half above. <br/><br/>1, 1, 2, 2, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, 5, 5, 5, 90<br/><br/>In this case there are an even number of values so the median is half way between the two middle values (3 and 4) so it is 3.5.<br/><br/>The modal value (most common) is 5 and the mean is 32.5 (sum of all values/ number of values which is 325/10= 32.5).<br/><br/>This is a good example to illustrate how the mean is sensitive to outliers whereas the median is not. Note how in this case a value of 32.5 does not give a good indication of an average for this range of values. This is due to the outlier of 90 which distorts the mean.<br/></div>
