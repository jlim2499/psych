<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A new biochemical marker has been found which is increased in mothers who are carrying fetuses with Down's syndrome. The new blood test is trialled in 1,000 women over the age of 35 years. Of these women 20 were found to be carrying a fetus with Down's syndrome as assessed using standard measures. The new test was positive in 15 of the 20 cases but was also positive in 30 of the remaining 980 women. What is the positive predictive value of the test?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">0.33</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>0.33</b>. The positive predictive value (PPV) of a test is the probability that subjects with a positive screening test truly have the disease. It can be calculated using the formula: PPV = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives). In this case, the true positives are 15 (women who tested positive and do have a fetus with Down's syndrome), and the false positives are 30 (women who tested positive but do not have a fetus with Down's syndrome). So, PPV = 15 / (15 + 30) = 0.33.<br/><br/><b>0.66</b> would be incorrect as it does not align with any calculation related to sensitivity, specificity, or predictive values in this context.<br/><br/><b>950/980</b> is also incorrect. Though it seems like it could represent specificity (True Negatives / Total without Disease), which would be calculated here as 950 (women who tested negative and do not have a fetus with Down's syndrome) divided by 980 (total women without Down's syndrome), this is not what was asked for in the question. The question specifically asks for Positive Predictive Value.<br/><br/><b>0.8</b> doesn't match any calculations relevant to this scenario either and hence is incorrect.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>0.5</b>, while mathematically possible if there were an equal number of true positives and false positives, does not align with the data given in this scenario where we know that there were more false positives than true positives.<br/><br/></div>
