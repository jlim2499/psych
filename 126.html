<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A study indicates that the antioxidant effects of blueberries may slow down the process of aging. A researcher wishes to explore this further by investigating the effect of blueberries on cognitive decline in people with mild cognitive impairment. They select groups of men with the condition who are given either a standard diet or a diet supplemented with blueberries, strawberries, or raspberries. Prior to the beginning of the study all participants were given memory tests using the MMSE. These were repeated after 6 months of the diet. <br/>Based on the above study select the true statement. <br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">The independent variable is the type of diet</span></div><br/>Explanation for the Correct Answer:<br/><br/>The independent variable in an experiment is the one that is manipulated or changed by the researchers to observe its effect on the dependent variable. In this case, the type of diet is what is being altered.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>The dependent variable is the standard diet: This is incorrect because the dependent variable is the outcome that is being measured in the study, which would be the change in cognitive function as measured by the MMSE, not the standard diet itself.<br/><br/>The independent variable is the gender of the participants: This is incorrect because the gender of the participants is not being manipulated; it is a characteristic of the participants.<br/><br/>The dependent variable is the antioxidant effect of the blueberries: This is incorrect because the antioxidant effect is a characteristic of the blueberries, not an outcome measured in the participants.<br/><br/>The independent variable is the degree of cognitive decline: This is incorrect as the degree of cognitive decline is what is being measured, making it the dependent variable, not the independent variable.<br/></div>
