<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>In a study of children with anxiety disorders, 76% of those receiving fluvoxamine and 29% of those receiving placebo were treatment responders. What is the number needed to treat (NNT)?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">3</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>3</b>. <br/><br/>The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is calculated from the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR), which is the difference in treatment response rates.<br/><br/>Fluoxetine response rate = 76%<br/><br/>Placebo response rate = 29%<br/><br/>ARR = 76% – 29% = 47% = 0.47<br/><br/>NNT = 1 / ARR = 1 / 0.47 ≈ 2.13<br/><br/>By convention, NNT is always rounded up, even if the result is just slightly over a whole number.<br/><br/>So, NNT = 3<br/><br/>This means that for every 3 children treated with fluvoxamine, 1 additional child will respond compared to placebo.<br/><br/>In contrast, for Number Needed to Harm (NNH), the convention is to round down, which avoids underestimating potential harm.<br/></div>
