<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Regarding research studies, which of the following is a recognised limitation of the Delphi method?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Potential low response rates</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Potential low response rates</b>. The Delphi method, a structured communication technique originally developed as a systematic, interactive forecasting method which relies on a panel of experts, has been widely used in various fields including healthcare research. One of its recognised limitations is the potential for low response rates. As its process involves several rounds of questionnaires sent to a panel of selected experts who are asked to provide their opinions on the topic at hand, there is always a risk that some may not respond or drop out during subsequent rounds. This can lead to bias and affect the validity of the results.<br/><br/><b>Anonymity and confidentiality of responses cannot be guaranteed</b> is incorrect. One of the key features of the Delphi method is that it ensures anonymity and confidentiality among participants. This allows each expert to express his or her opinion freely without any influence from other members of the group.<br/><br/><b>It is very expensive</b> is also incorrect. Compared with other research methods such as randomised controlled trials or cohort studies, conducting a Delphi study generally requires fewer resources and less funding. It mainly involves designing and distributing questionnaires, collecting responses, analysing data, and feeding back results to participants.<br/><br/>The assertion that <b>it cannot be used when experts are geographically dispersed</b> is another incorrect option. In fact, one advantage of the Delphi method is that it can be conducted remotely via email or online platforms, making it possible to include experts from different geographical locations.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>it involves direct confrontation of experts with one another</b> is wrong as well. The Delphi method avoids direct confrontation between participants by maintaining their anonymity throughout the process. Instead, disagreements are resolved through iterative rounds where feedback about group's opinion is provided allowing individuals to refine their views based on this information.<br/><br/></div>
