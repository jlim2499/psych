<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>The Royal College of Psychiatrists conducts a study on a random sample of trainees to investigate how many complaints are made against trainees whilst in training. The results are normally distributed with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 2. What proportion of the sample got 3 or more complaints?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">85%</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>85%</b>. To determine the proportion of the sample that received 3 or more complaints, we need to consider the properties of the normal distribution. Given a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 2, we know the following:<br/><br/>Approximately 68.3% of values lie within one standard deviation of the mean (between 3 and 7 complaints in this case).<br/><br/>This means that 34.15% of values lie above the mean (5 complaints) and below one standard deviation above the mean (7 complaints), and another 34.15% lie below the mean and above one standard deviation below the mean (3 complaints).<br/><br/>The remaining 31.7% of values lie outside this range, equally split with 15.85% below 3 complaints and 15.85% above 7 complaints.<br/><br/>Since we are only interested in the proportion of values that lie above 3 complaints, we combine the 68.3% (within the range of 3 to 7 complaints) and the 15.85% (above 7 complaints), giving us:<br/><br/>68.3% + 15.85% = 84.15%, which approximates to 85%.<br/></div>
