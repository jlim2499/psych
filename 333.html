<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is used to calculate the variance of a sample?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Mean</span></div><br/>The correct answer is the <b>mean</b>. Variance is a statistical measure that tells us how much a set of observations differ from each other. It is calculated by taking the average of squared differences from the mean. In this case, we first calculate the mean (average) of a sample, then subtract each data point from the mean and square the result, finally compute the average of those squared differences to get variance.<br/><br/><b>P-value</b> is not used to calculate variance. P-value is a statistical concept that measures the strength of evidence in support of a null hypothesis. It calculates the probability that you would observe your data given that null hypothesis was true. Therefore, it's used more in hypothesis testing rather than calculating variance.<br/><br/>The <b>median</b> also doesn't help in calculating variance. Median refers to the middle value in a dataset when arranged in ascending or descending order. Unlike mean, median isn't affected by extreme values (outliers) in a dataset and therefore can't be used to calculate variance which requires considering all values including outliers.<br/><br/><b>Confidence interval</b>, another incorrect option, provides an estimated range of values which is likely to include an unknown population parameter. The width of this range indicates level of uncertainty about estimate but it doesn't involve calculation of variation within sample itself.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>interquartile range</b>, although it does measure dispersion like variance, cannot be used to calculate variance itself. Interquartile range considers only middle 50% of data points (from 25th percentile to 75th percentile), ignoring outliers and therefore does not represent total variability within a dataset as required for calculating variance.<br/></div>
