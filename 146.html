<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A consultant psychiatrist is keen to investigate how effective day care services are for individuals with dementia or Alzheimer's disease in alleviating caregiver burden?<br/>How should this search be entered into PubMed to identify the appropriate studies?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Day care AND (dementia OR Alzheimer's) AND caregiver burden</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Day care AND (dementia OR Alzheimer's) AND caregiver burden</b>. This search strategy is the most effective as it uses the Boolean operator 'AND' to narrow down the search to include all three key concepts: day care, dementia or Alzheimer's, and caregiver burden. The use of brackets correctly groups 'dementia OR Alzheimer's', ensuring that studies involving either dementia or Alzheimer's are included. <br/><br/><b>Day care AND (dementia AND Alzheimer's) AND caregiver burden</b> is incorrect because it restricts the search results to only those studies where both dementia and Alzheimer's are present in the same individual. This is not appropriate since dementia and Alzheimer's are not always co-existing conditions; a person can have one without having the other.<br/><br/><b>Day care OR caregiver burden AND (dementia AND Alzheimer's)</b> is also incorrect. Using 'OR' between day care and caregiver burden would result in articles that mention either term, thus retrieving irrelevant studies that do not necessarily involve both day care and caregiver burden.<br/><br/><b>Day care OR (dementia OR Alzheimer's) AND caregiver burden</b> is another incorrect option. This will retrieve articles that mention either day care or dementia/Alzheimer's along with caregiver burden. This could lead to inclusion of unrelated articles, for example ones discussing outpatient services for dementia patients with no reference to day care services.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Day care AND dementia OR Alzheimer's AND caregiver burden</b>, without parentheses around 'dementia OR Alzheimer’s', would lead to an imprecise search as it might pull up articles about day care and dementia without any reference to Alzheimer’s or vice versa, along with unrelated references to caregiver burden.<br/></div>
