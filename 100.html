<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>When interpreting the results of a Kappa statistic in a study evaluating the reliability of a new screening tool for anxiety disorders, a Kappa value of 0.65 indicates:<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Substantial agreement</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Substantial agreement</b>. A Kappa value of 0.65 indicates substantial agreement between raters, as it falls within the range of 0.61 to 0.80. This level of agreement demonstrates good reliability in the context of a screening tool for anxiety disorders, meaning that the tool produces consistent results between different observers. This is crucial in clinical practice to ensure the screening tool is reliable for widespread use.<br/><br/><b>Poor agreement</b>: This would correspond to a Kappa value below 0, indicating that the agreement is worse than expected by chance. A Kappa of 0.65 is far above this threshold, showing that the raters are consistently aligned in their evaluations.<br/><br/><b>Fair agreement</b>: A Kappa value of 0.21 to 0.40 indicates fair agreement, which is notably lower than substantial agreement. A value of 0.65 is well beyond this range, reflecting a higher degree of reliability.<br/><br/><b>Moderate agreement</b>: Moderate agreement falls between 0.41 and 0.60. While this is closer to 0.65, the value of 0.65 exceeds this range and moves into the category of substantial agreement.<br/><br/><b>Almost perfect agreement</b>: Almost perfect agreement corresponds to a Kappa value of 0.81 to 1.00. A value of 0.65 does not meet this threshold, so while the agreement is strong, it is not near-perfect.<br/></div>
