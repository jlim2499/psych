<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>The standardised mortality ratio for a group of  patients with antisocial personality disorder is 120% (95% CI 90-130).  Which of the following is the correct interpretation of this result?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">The result does not conclusively indicate a significantly increased or decreased mortality rate</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>The result does not conclusively indicate a significantly increased or decreased mortality rate</b>. The confidence interval (90-130) includes 100, which means the result could suggest either an increased or decreased mortality rate compared to the general population, but this difference is not statistically significant.<br/><br/><b>Patients with antisocial personality disorder have a significantly increased mortality rate</b>: This option is incorrect because although the SMR is 120%, the confidence interval includes 100. Therefore, we cannot conclude that there is a significantly increased mortality rate.<br/><br/><b>Patients with antisocial personality disorder have a significantly decreased mortality rate</b>: This option is incorrect because a decreased mortality rate would be represented by an SMR less than 100, and the confidence interval would need to be entirely below 100. Neither condition is met here.<br/><br/><b>Patients with antisocial personality disorder have a mortality rate similar to the normal population</b>: This option is incorrect because although the confidence interval includes 100, indicating that the mortality rate could be similar to the normal population, itâ€™s not the most accurate interpretation compared to acknowledging the statistical uncertainty with the result.<br/><br/><b>Antisocial personality disorder is a protective factor for premature death</b>: This option is incorrect because a protective factor would correspond to an SMR less than 100, with a confidence interval entirely below 100. The given SMR of 120% does not support this conclusion.<br/></div>
