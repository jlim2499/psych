<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>You are conducting a study to compare the effects of three different diets, each with a distinct sugar content, on weight gain. Which statistical test is most appropriate to determine whether there are significant differences in mean weight gain between the groups?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">ANOVA</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>ANOVA</b>. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is the most appropriate test in this scenario because it compares the means of three or more groups (in this case, the diets) to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between them. ANOVA also evaluates the variability within and between groups to detect these differences.<br/><br/>Five Steps:<br/><br/>1) Define the Research Question: The question is whether different diets (categorical independent variable) have varying effects on weight gain (continuous dependent variable).<br/>2) Establish the Number of Groups and Dependency: There are three independent groups (each diet is distinct, and participants are not related across groups).<br/>3) Identify the Variables and Data Types: Independent variable: Diet type (categorical, with three levels: Diet 1, Diet 2, Diet 3). Dependent variable: Weight gain (continuous, interval/ratio).<br/>4) Determine Parametric vs Non-Parametric: Since the dependent variable (weight gain) is continuous and normally distributed, a parametric test is appropriate.<br/>5) Select the Statistical Test: ANOVA is selected because it compares the means of three or more independent groups.<br/><br/><b>Chi-squared test</b> is incorrect because it is used to evaluate relationships between categorical variables. In this scenario, the dependent variable (weight gain) is continuous and not categorical.<br/><br/><b>Student's t-test</b> is incorrect because it compares the means of only two groups. Since this study involves three diets, ANOVA is more suitable.<br/><br/><b>Wilcoxonâ€™s test</b> is incorrect because it is a non-parametric test designed to compare paired or related samples, not independent groups or multiple groups.<br/><br/><b>Mann Whitney U</b> is incorrect because it is a non-parametric test for comparing the medians of two independent groups. It does not account for multiple groups or provide insights into variance between groups.<br/></div>
