Which measure of central tendency would most accurately represent the average performance of the test-takers?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Median</span></div><br/><i><b>Previous Exam Question</b></i><br/><br/>The correct answer is <b>Median</b>. In a negatively skewed distribution, the median is the most accurate measure of central tendency for representing the average performance because it is not influenced by extreme values (i.e., the long tail on the left). The median divides the data into two equal halves, making it more representative of the central point of the data.<br/><br/><b>Geometric mean</b>: This is inappropriate for skewed distributions, as it assumes all data points are positive and is best used for multiplicative data, such as rates or ratios. It does not provide a clear representation of central tendency in test scores.<br/><br/><b>Harmonic mean</b>: This is also not suitable for skewed data. The harmonic mean is heavily influenced by small values, which would exaggerate the effect of the negatively skewed tail, making it a poor choice for summarising test performance.<br/><br/><b>Mean</b>: The mean is affected by extreme values, such as those in the left tail of a negatively skewed distribution. This makes it less accurate in representing the central tendency compared to the median.<br/><br/><b>Mode</b>: While the mode represents the most frequently occurring value, it may not accurately reflect the central performance of the data, especially in skewed distributions where the data points are unevenly spread.<br/></div>
