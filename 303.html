<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is the correct formula for calculating the likelihood ratio for a positive test result?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Sensitivity / (1 - specificity)</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">LR+ = sensitivity / (1 - specificity)</div>The correct answer is <b>Sensitivity / (1 - specificity)</b>. The likelihood ratio for a positive test result (LR+) is calculated by dividing the probability of a true positive result (sensitivity) by the probability of a false positive result (1 - specificity). This formula provides a measure of how much more likely it is that a positive test result will occur in someone with the disease compared to someone without the disease. <br/><br/><b>Specificity / (1 - sensitivity)</b> is incorrect as this formula would be used to calculate the likelihood ratio for a negative test result (LR-), not a positive one. The LR- compares the probability of a true negative result (specificity) with the probability of a false negative result (1 - sensitivity).<br/><br/>The option <b>(Sensitivity - 1) / (specificity - 1)</b> is also incorrect. This formula does not correspond to any standard calculations used in medical statistics for diagnostic testing.<br/><br/>Similarly, <b>(Sensitivity - 1) / specificity</b> is not correct. Subtraction of one from either sensitivity or specificity before performing these calculations fundamentally alters their interpretation and does not provide useful information about diagnostic accuracy.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Specificity / (sensitivity - 1)</b> is wrong too. As previously mentioned, subtracting one from sensitivity or specificity changes their meaning and this particular formula has no relevance in calculating likelihood ratios.<br/><br/>In conclusion, understanding how to correctly calculate likelihood ratios can help clinicians interpret diagnostic tests more accurately and make better clinical decisions.<br/></div>
