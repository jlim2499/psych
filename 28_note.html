For example the attributable risk for lung cancer in smokers is the rate of lung cancer in smokers minus the rate of cancer in non smokers.  Essentially it tells you what proportion of deaths in the exposed group were potentially due to the exposure.    <br/><br/>The relative risk (RR) is the risk of an event relative to exposure.  It is also known as the risk ratio.  <br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid1"><thead><tr><th></th><th><b>Diseased</b></th><th><b>Not diseased</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Exposed</b></td><td>a</td><td>b</td></tr><tr><td><b>Not exposed</b></td><td>c</td><td>d</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>The relative risk is calculated by the following formula<br/>RR= a/(a+b) divided by c/(c+d)<br/><br/>Interpreting the RR is simple, for example if the RR of developing a side effect in drug X compared to drug Y is 20 then people taking drug X would be 20 times more likely to develop the side effect than people taking drug Y.  (Note: the same cannot be done with the odds ratio)<br/><br/>A relative risk of 1 means there is no difference between the two groups.<br/>A relative risk of &lt;1 means that the event is less likely to occur in the exposed group.<br/>A relative risk of &gt;1 means that the event is more likely to occur in the exposed group.<br/><br/>The population attributable risk can be described as the reduction in incidence that would be observed if the population were entirely unexposed.  For instance how would the incidence of lung cancer change if everyone stopped smoking?  It can be calculated by multiplying the attributable risk by the prevalence of exposure in the population.<br/> <br/>The attributable proportion is the proportion of the disease that would be eliminated in a population if its disease rate were reduced to that of the unexposed group.</div></div>
