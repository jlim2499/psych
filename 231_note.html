Then our estimate of simple cumulative incidence is 50 over 1000, or 0.05, or, 5%. In other words, the 10-year risk, technically the cumulative incidence for a 45 year-old male is estimated to be 5%. </i><br/><br/>Cumulative incidence can be thought of as the average risk of getting a disease over a certain period of time (a risk is the probability of getting a disease).  A commonly cited measure of cumulative incidence is the lifetime risk'.<br/><br/>Cumulative incidence is usually reserved for fixed populations, particularly when there are no or few losses to follow-up.<br/><br/>Incidence rate:<br/><br/>A rate is a measure of the speed at which something is happening. This is true for the incidence rate which aims to summarise the speed at which new cases emerge.<br/><br/>To calculate the incidence rate, we must follow a cohort of subjects, count the number of new (or incident) cases (I) of a disease in that cohort, and compute the total time, called person-time (PT), that disease-free individuals in the cohort are observed over the study period. The estimated incidence rate (IR) is obtained by dividing I by PT.<br/>IR = I / PT<br/><br/><i>As an example, consider a cohort of 12 initially disease-free subjects followed over a 5-year period from 1990 to 1995 (see below):</i><br/><br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mma121.png"/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/><i>The estimated incidence rate is 0.2 per person-year.<br/><br/>From these data, the number of new cases is 5. The total person-time, in this case person-years, is obtained by adding the individual observed disease-free follow-up times this gives a total of 25 person years. The rate is therefore 5 divided by 25 or 0.20, which can be translated as 20 new cases per 100 person years of follow-up.</i><br/><br/>Note that the numerator for incidence rate is identical to that of cumulative incidence. The difference between the two measures lies in the denominator. The incidence rates denominator integrates time (t), and so it is a true rate. Thus, its dimension is 1/t, and its possible values range from zero to infinity.  An incidence rate of infinity is possible if all members of a population die instantaneously.<br/><br/>The concept of person-time can be difficult to understand. Person-time is accrued only among candidates for the disease.  Thus, a person contributes time to the denominator of an incidence rate only up until he or she is diagnosed with the disease of interest.  However,  unlike  for  cumulative incidence, the incidence rate is not based upon the assumption that everyone  in  the  candidate  population  has  been  followed  for  a  specified  time period. Person-time is accrued only while the candidate is being followed. Accrual of person-time stops when the person dies or is lost to follow-up (such  as  when  a  person  moves  away  from  a  community).<br/><br/>The incidence rate can be calculated for either a fixed or dynamic population. However, because  it  directly  takes  into  account  population  changes  (such  as  migration, birth, and death), it is especially useful as a measure of the transition between health and disease in dynamic populations. <br/><br/><b>Prevalence</b><br/><br/><ul><li>Point prevalence</li><li>Period prevalence</li></ul><br/>Prevalence is a proportion and is a measure of the burden of disease within a population.<br/><br/>Point prevalence = number of cases in a defined population / number of people in a defined population at the same time<br/><br/>Period prevalence = number of identified cases during a specified period of time / total number of people in that population<br/><br/><b>Key points</b><br/><br/><ul><li>Prevalence = incidence x duration of condition</li><li>In chronic diseases the prevalence is much greater than the incidence</li><li>The incidence rate is stated in units of person-time</li><li>Cumulative incidence is always a proportion</li><li>When describing cumulative incidence, it is necessary to give the follow-up period over which the risk is estimated</li><li>In acute diseases the prevalence and incidence are similar.
