All the studies report the relative risk of developing an upper gastrointestinal bleed compared to a control population.<br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/img040.jpg"/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/>Which one of the studies provides the most statistically significant evidence that the new drug does not cause gastrointestinal bleeding?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Atkinson et al</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Atkinson et al.</b>. Atkinson et al. provides the most statistically significant evidence that the new drug does not cause gastrointestinal bleeding. This is because the relative risk reported is less than 1, and the confidence interval does not cross 1, indicating a statistically significant protective effect or no increased risk compared to the control population.<br/><br/><b>Dennis et al.</b> also shows a relative risk less than 1 with a confidence interval that does not cross 1, indicating a statistically significant protective effect or no increased risk. However, the point estimate and confidence interval are closer to 1 compared to Atkinson et al., suggesting slightly less robust evidence.<br/><br/><b>Dee et al.</b> shows a relative risk slightly greater than 1 with a confidence interval crossing 1, indicating no statistically significant difference in the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding compared to the control group.<br/><br/><b>Fry et al.</b> reports a relative risk less than 1, but the confidence interval crosses 1, indicating no statistically significant protective effect or difference in the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding compared to the control group.<br/><br/><b>Brand et al.</b> reports a relative risk greater than 1 with a confidence interval that crosses 1, indicating no statistically significant increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding compared to the control group.<br/><br/>Explanation of the Size of the Boxes:<br/><br/>In a forest plot, the size of the boxes represents the weight or the relative contribution of each study to the overall meta-analysis. This weight is typically determined by the precision of the study's estimate, which is often related to the sample size and the variance of the outcome:<br/><br/>Large Boxes: Indicate that the study has a large sample size or high precision, meaning its results have a greater influence on the overall estimate of the meta-analysis.<br/><br/>Small Boxes: Represent studies with smaller sample sizes or less precision, contributing less to the overall estimate.<br/>Understanding the weight of each study is crucial because it helps clinicians and researchers gauge which studies are contributing most to the overall findings. Larger studies with more precise estimates have a more significant impact on the meta-analysis outcome, providing more robust evidence.<br/></div>
