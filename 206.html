When calculating the sample variance, the correct denominator is n−1, where n is the number of observations in the sample. This adjustment is known as Bessel's correction and is used to correct the bias in the estimation of the population variance from a sample. Dividing by n−1 rather than n compensates for the fact that the sample mean is used as an estimate of the population mean, which introduces a degree of uncertainty. This correction ensures that the sample variance is an unbiased estimator of the population variance. In clinical research, particularly in psychiatry, where sample sizes may be small, using the correct formula ensures accurate estimates of variability and improves the reliability of statistical testing and confidence intervals.<br/><br/><b>N</b> is incorrect. N typically refers to the size of the population, not the sample. When the variance of an entire population is calculated (which is rare in practice), division by N is appropriate. However, in nearly all clinical and research contexts, we work with samples rather than full populations.<br/><br/><b>n</b> is incorrect. Using n as the denominator gives a biased estimate of the population variance, underestimating its true value, particularly in small samples. This approach fails to account for the variability introduced by estimating the mean from the sample itself.<br/><br/><b>1−x</b> is incorrect. This is not a valid term in the context of variance calculation. It has no statistical meaning in this setting and may reflect a misunderstanding of the formula structure.<br/><br/><b>x</b> is incorrect. x generally represents a data point or a variable, not a denominator. Variance is calculated from squared deviations from the mean and involves summing these deviations across all values, not dividing by a single data point.<br/></div>
