<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which one of the following statements regarding significance tests is correct?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Chi-squared test is used to compare non-parametric data</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Chi-squared test is used to compare non-parametric data</b>.<br/><br/>The chi-squared test is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant association between categorical variables. It is appropriate for non-parametric data, such as frequencies or counts in different categories, rather than continuous data.<br/><br/>Explanations for Incorrect Options:<br/><b>Parametric data is not normally distributed</b>: This statement is incorrect. Parametric data assumes a normal distribution, which is one of the key criteria for applying parametric tests such as the t-test or ANOVA.<br/><br/><b>A independent t-test may be performed on paired or unpaired data</b>: This statement is incorrect. The independent t-test is specifically for unpaired data. The paired t-test is used when the data is dependent or related, such as repeated measures on the same subjects.<br/><br/><b>Pearson's product-moment coefficient is used to assess causation</b>: This statement is incorrect. Pearsonâ€™s correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two continuous variables. It does not imply or assess causation, as correlation does not equal causation.<br/><br/><b>The dependent variable is something that an experimenter purposely changes over the course of a study</b>: This statement is incorrect. The dependent variable is the outcome being measured in a study, while the independent variable is what the experimenter manipulates or categorises to observe its effect on the dependent variable.<br/></div>
