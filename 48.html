Construct validity is the overarching term that refers to how well a test or tool measures the theoretical psychological construct it claims to assess. In this case, it is not enough to simply correlate with other measures — it must also be grounded in a theoretical framework, distinguish the target construct from others (discriminant validity), and show associations with relevant variables (convergent validity). Clinically, this ensures that a questionnaire assessing anxiety is not inadvertently measuring related but distinct phenomena like depression or general distress. For example, a well-validated anxiety scale should correlate strongly with other established anxiety measures, but not with unrelated constructs like psychotic symptoms.<br/><br/><b>Construct validity is demonstrated when the questionnaire shows a high correlation with other validated measures of the same construct</b> is an example of convergent validity, which is a subtype of construct validity. However, on its own, it is not a sufficient demonstration of the full scope of construct validity.<br/><br/><b>Construct validity refers to the questionnaire's ability to predict outcomes theoretically related to the construct of anxiety</b> is closer to predictive validity, which may support construct validity but is not the full definition.<br/><br/><b>Construct validity is the extent to which the questionnaire captures the theoretical components of anxiety, as supported by existing research and expert consensus on the construct</b> reflects an important element — namely, content validity and theoretical grounding — but still doesn’t fully capture the empirical aspect involved in construct validation.<br/><br/><b>Construct validity is established when the results of the questionnaire can be generalised across different populations and settings</b> refers to external validity or generalisability, not construct validity.<br/></div>
