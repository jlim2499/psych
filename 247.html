<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Relative risk (RR) is a ratio of the probability of an event occurring in an exposed group compared to a non-exposed group. If the relative risk is 10, what does this indicate in terms of the likelihood of an event occurring in the exposed group?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">The risk of the event in the exposed group is higher than in the unexposed group</span></div><br/>Why 'The risk of the event in the exposed group is higher than in the unexposed group' is correct:<br/><br/>Relative risk (RR) is the ratio of the probability of an event occurring in the exposed group to the probability of the event in the non-exposed group. An RR of 10 means that the event is 10 times as likely to occur in the exposed group than in the unexposed group, indicating a higher risk for the exposed group.<br/><br/>Why the other options are incorrect:<br/><br/>'There is no difference between the groups': This would be incorrect because an RR of 1, not 10, would indicate no difference in risk between the two groups.<br/><br/>'The risk of the event in the unexposed group is 10 times that of the exposed group': This statement is the opposite of what an RR of 10 signifies. An RR of 0.1 would suggest that the risk in the unexposed group is 10 times that of the exposed group, not an RR of 10.<br/><br/>'The risk of the event in the exposed group is less than in that of the unexposed group': This is incorrect as an RR greater than 1, such as 10, indicates that the risk is higher in the exposed group, not lower.<br/><br/>'The odds of the event in the exposed group is 10': This statement is incorrect because it confuses 'relative risk' with 'odds'. While similar, they are not the same; 'odds' are a different measurement and would be expressed as an 'odds ratio', not a 'relative risk'.<br/></div>
