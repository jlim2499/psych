<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Given that 6 out of every 10 patients given risperidone gain weight, what are the odds of gaining weight if given risperidone?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">1.5</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>1.5</b>. The odds ratio is calculated by dividing the odds of an event occurring by the odds of it not occurring. In this case, the event is gaining weight after being given risperidone. Given that 6 out of every 10 patients gain weight, there are 4 out of every 10 who do not. Therefore, the odds ratio would be (6/4) which equals to 1.5.<br/><br/>Now let's consider each incorrect answer:<br/><br/><b>0.4</b>: This answer would suggest that the odds of gaining weight are less than half the odds of not gaining weight when given risperidone, which contradicts with our data stating that more patients gain weight than those who don't.<br/><br/><b>1.6</b>: This value is slightly higher than the correct answer. It could be a result from miscalculation or perhaps confusion between calculating a risk ratio and an odds ratio.<br/><br/><b>1.2</b>: This figure suggests that for every 5 patients who do not gain weight on risperidone, six will - which does not match with our data where we know that for every four patients who do not gain weight, six will.<br/><br/><b>0.6</b>: Similar to option '0.4', this option also suggests that fewer people gain weight as compared to those who do not when given risperidone - again contradicting with our provided statistics.<br/><br/>In conclusion, understanding how to calculate and interpret an odds ratio is crucial in medical research and practice as it helps in quantifying how strongly the presence or absence of property A is associated with the presence or absence of factor B in a given population.<br/><br/></div>
