<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Regarding evidence based medicine, which of the following is an example of a background question?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">What is the incidence of breast cancer in females diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder?</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>'What is the incidence of breast cancer in females diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder?'</b>. A background question in evidence-based medicine (EBM) is a question that seeks basic or general knowledge about a condition or thing. It typically asks for information such as the incidence, prevalence, diagnostic criteria, pathophysiology or risk factors of a disease. In this case, the question is asking about the incidence rate of breast cancer among females who have been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder. It does not ask about any specific intervention or comparison.<br/><br/>The other options are examples of foreground questions. Foreground questions are more specific and often relate to particular patients, interventions or therapies.<br/><br/><b>'Does hand washing among healthcare workers reduce hospital acquired infections?'</b> This is a foreground question because it seeks to determine whether a specific intervention (hand washing) influences an outcome (reduction of hospital acquired infections). <br/><br/><b>'Does early debriefing lead to a reduction of the duration of post-traumatic stress disorder?'</b> This too is a foreground question as it's asking whether an intervention (early debriefing) has an impact on an outcome (duration of PTSD).<br/><br/><b>'Is atomoxetine effective at reducing the severity of restrictive and repetitive behaviours in autism?'</b> Again, this is another example of a foreground question since it's asking about the effectiveness of a certain drug (atomoxetine) on managing symptoms associated with autism.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>'Is regular contact with a community nurse associated with improved functioning in patients with depression?'</b> Here, this question examines if an intervention (regular contact with community nurse) leads to an improvement in patient outcomes for those suffering from depression. Hence, it's also considered as a foreground question.<br/></div>
