<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A range of 1 standard deviation above and below the mean includes what percentage of the values?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">68.2 %</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>68.2 %</b>. In a normal distribution, 1 standard deviation above and below the mean includes approximately 68.2% of the values. This is a fundamental concept in statistics and is essential for understanding data variability, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing in medical research.<br/><br/>The option <b>72.6 %</b> is incorrect. There isn't a standard statistical rule or principle that associates this particular percentage with the range of 1 standard deviation from the mean in a normal distribution.<br/><br/>The option <b>95.4 %</b> is also incorrect but it's close to an important value in statistics. Approximately 95% (more precisely 95.45%) of values lie within 2 standard deviations from the mean in a normal distribution, not one.<br/><br/>Similarly, <b>84.2 %</b> doesn't correspond to any known statistical rule related to standard deviations in a normal distribution, making it an incorrect choice as well.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>99.7 %</b>, although incorrect for this question, represents another key principle - The empirical rule or three-sigma rule states that nearly all values (99.7%) lie within three standard deviations from the mean in a normally distributed set of data.<br/><br/>Understanding these percentages and their relation to standard deviations from the mean are crucial for interpreting many types of medical research findings and for conducting your own investigations.<br/><br/></div>
