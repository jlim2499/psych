<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is best described as a nominal variable?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Ethnic group</span></div><br/>Explanation for the Correct Answer:<br/><br/>Ethnic group is the correct option. A nominal variable is one that categorizes data without a natural order or ranking. Ethnic groups are categories that do not have a mathematical order or rank.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Height (in meters) is a ratio variable, as it can be measured on a continuous scale and has a true zero point.<br/><br/>Social class, although often considered a categorical variable, typically has an inherent order (lower, middle, upper) and is therefore ordinal rather than nominal.<br/><br/>Weight (is measured in grams) is also a ratio variable for the same reasons as height'it is continuous and has a true zero.<br/><br/>Age (if categorised as young, middle-aged, or old) represents an ordinal variable because the categories have a natural order.<br/></div>
