Various costs need to be factored in such as 'direct costs' (e.g. doctor's time), 'indirect costs' (e.g. productivity issues due to being off work), and 'future costs' (e.g. development of diabetes as a consequence of treatment with clozapine).<br/><br/>The different economic evaluations vary mainly due to the way in which outcomes are assessed.<br/></div>
