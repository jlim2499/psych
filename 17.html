Simple partial seizures are not followed by a rise in serum prolactin and prolactin concentrations may be normal after prolonged status epilepticus. Blood must be taken between 20 and 30 minutes after the seizure and compared with a baseline sample. <br/><br/>The test is, however, used less and less in specialist centers as false positive results have been found in syncope and dissociative seizures (Mellers, 2005).<br/><br/>Mellers (2005) The approach to patients with ''non-epileptic seizures''.
