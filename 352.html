<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A junior psychiatrist seeks to explore if there is a connection between vitamin K injections given to newborns and the development of autism. They select a group of children with autism and a comparable control group and then interview the parents of the children. Parents are asked if their child received the vitamin K injection after the delivery. <br/>Their results indicate that a greater number of cases than controls received the injection after the delivery.<br/><br/>Which of the following sources of bias is most likely to account for this finding?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Information bias</span></div><br/>The most likely explanation for the result is recall bias which is a form of information bias.<br/><br/>In the study it is quite possible that the parents of those affected by autism will have a better recall of whether the injection was given or not as they are more likely to have thought about what might have caused the autism. Those with children without the condition are likely to have forgotten if the injection was ever given.<br/><br/>A better approach to such a study would be to retrieve the original case records for each child.<br/></div>
