<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Regarding hypothesis testing.  A type II error is also known by which term?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">False negative</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Type I error = alpha error, error of the first kind, or a false positive<br/><br/>Type II error = beta error, error of the second kind or the false negative</div>Explanation for the Correct Answer:<br/><br/>False negative is the correct term associated with a Type II error in hypothesis testing. A Type II error occurs when the test fails to reject the null hypothesis when in fact the alternative hypothesis is true, meaning a real effect or difference exists but the test incorrectly indicates that there is no effect or difference.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Error of the first kind is synonymous with a Type I error, not a Type II error. A Type I error occurs when the test incorrectly rejects a true null hypothesis.<br/><br/>True positive is not an error but a correct identification. It occurs when the test correctly identifies a true effect or difference.<br/><br/>Alpha error is another term for a Type I error, not a Type II error. It represents the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis.<br/><br/>True negative is also not an error but a correct rejection. It occurs when the test correctly fails to reject the null hypothesis when there is no real effect or difference.<br/></div>
