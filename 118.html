She is asked to give an overview of her findings to the rest of the team.<br/><br/>Her findings are as follows:<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid1"><thead><tr><th>Patient</th><th>No of cigarettes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>3</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>Given her results, select the most appropriate answer for each of the following.<br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>136.</b></td><td>What is the mean of her sample?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>5</b> To calculate the mean number of cigarettes smoked by the patients, we sum the total number of cigarettes smoked and divide by the number of patients.<br/><br/>Here are the numbers of cigarettes smoked by each patient:<br/>1, 4, 3, 6, 2, 7, 18, 3, 7, 2, 4, 3<br/><br/>First, calculate the total sum:<br/>1 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 2 + 7 + 18 + 3 + 7 + 2 + 4 + 3 = 60<br/><br/>Now, divide by the number of patients:<br/>Mean = Total sum / Number of patients<br/>Mean = 60 / 12<br/>Mean = 5<br/><br/>So, the mean number of cigarettes smoked by the patients is <b>5</b>.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>137.</b></td><td>What is the median of her sample?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>3.5</b> The median is the value (in this case not one of the actual values of the dataset) that divides the dataset in half.<br/><br/>To find the median number of cigarettes smoked, we first need to arrange the numbers in ascending order and then find the middle value. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.<br/><br/>Here are the numbers of cigarettes smoked by each patient in ascending order:<br/>1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, 7, 18<br/><br/>Since there are 12 observations, the median will be the average of the 6th and 7th values:<br/>The 6th value is 3, and the 7th value is 4.<br/><br/>Median = (3 + 4) / 2<br/>Median = 7 / 2<br/>Median = 3.5<br/><br/>So, the median number of cigarettes smoked by the patients is <b>3.5</b>.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>138.</b></td><td>Which summary measure gives the best description of the of central tendency of the data?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Median</b> The correct answer is <b>Median</b>. The median is the most appropriate measure of central tendency for summarising the data on the number of cigarettes smoked by patients. It is less affected by extreme values or outliers, such as the patient who smoked 18 cigarettes. In this context, the median provides a better representation of the typical number of cigarettes smoked by the patients on the ward, which helps in understanding the overall smoking behaviour more accurately.<br/><br/><b>Mode</b> refers to the most frequently occurring value in the dataset. While it indicates that the most common number of cigarettes smoked is 3, it does not account for the distribution of other values, making it less effective for summarising the central tendency in a dataset with varied values.<br/><br/><b>Mean</b> is the arithmetic average of the dataset. In this case, the mean is 5, but it is influenced by the extreme value of 18 cigarettes smoked by one patient. This makes the mean less representative of the central tendency in the presence of such outliers.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/></div>
