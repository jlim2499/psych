<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A consultant liaison psychiatrist presents a case of a depressed patient with cancer who they had reviewed on a hospital ward.  He rated the patient's cancer as 'severe'. His description of the patient's cancer conforms to which of the following data types?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Ordinal</span></div><br/><b><i>Previous Exam Question</i></b><br/><br/>Using a scale such as mild, moderate, and severe, represents ordinal data. There is clearly an order to the data as severe cancer is worse than moderate which is worse than mild. The difference between mild and moderate is not necessarily the same as that between moderate and severe and so this does not conform to an interval scale.<br/></div>
