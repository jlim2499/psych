<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A researcher wants to investigate a drug's affect on a person's heart rate.  He hypothesises that the drug will speed up peoples heart rates.  What type of hypothesis is this?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">One tailed alternative hypothesis</span></div><br/>The correct answer to this question is the <b>One tailed alternative hypothesis</b>. The researcher is predicting a specific direction of the effect of the drug, i.e. an increase in heart rate. This makes it a one-tailed hypothesis as it only considers one outcome or direction. An alternative hypothesis (H1) is a statement that directly contradicts the null hypothesis by stating that the actual value of a population parameter is less than, greater than, or not equal to the value stated in the null hypothesis.<br/><br/>The <b>Null hypothesis</b> would be incorrect because it posits no effect or relationship between variables. In this case, if we were to formulate a null hypothesis for this study, it would be something along the lines of 'the drug has no effect on heart rate'. <br/><br/>The option <b>One tailed null hypothesis</b> is also incorrect because there's no such thing as a 'one-tailed' null hypothesis. A null hypothesis always posits no effect or relationship and thus doesn't predict a direction.<br/><br/><b>Two tailed alternative hypothesis</b>, while an existing type of hypotheses, would not be correct for this situation either. A two-tailed alternative hypothesis predicts an effect or relationship but does not specify a direction - it could be an increase or decrease or any change from the norm in two possible directions. However, in our scenario, the researcher specifically hypothesises that heart rates will increase so his prediction is directional.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Two tailed null hypothesis</b> is incorrect because again there's no such thing as a 'two-tailed' null hypothesis. A null hypothesis always posits no effect or relationship and does not consider any specific directionality.<br/><br/></div>
