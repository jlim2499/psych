<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following correctly describes the purpose of descriptive statistics?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">To present a characteristic features of a data set</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>To present a characteristic features of a data set</b>. Descriptive statistics summarise and describe the features of a dataset, giving a clear overview of the dataâ€™s distribution, central tendency, and variability through measures such as the mean, median, mode, range, and standard deviation. This allows for a concise presentation of large amounts of data for easy understanding and comparison.<br/><br/><b>To determine if a sample accurately describes the population from which it is drawn</b> is incorrect. This is typically the realm of inferential statistics, which use samples to make inferences or predictions about a population.<br/><br/><b>To determine whether two population means are equal</b> is incorrect. This is also a task for inferential statistics, specifically hypothesis testing, rather than descriptive statistics.<br/><br/><b>To make an estimation of a population mean from a sample</b> is not the primary purpose of descriptive statistics. This is part of inferential statistics, which estimate population parameters based on sample statistics.<br/><br/><b>To test hypotheses based on sample data</b> is incorrect. Hypothesis testing is a function of inferential statistics, not descriptive statistics.<br/></div>
