<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A new blood test is developed for diagnosing bowel cancer and is compared to the gold standard of biopsy. The study reveals that the test has a sensitivity 60% of and a specificity of 80%.<br/>A patient receives a negative test result. What is the likelihood ratio for a negative test result?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">0.5</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>0.5</b>. The likelihood ratio for a negative test (LR-) is calculated by using the formula: LR- = (1-sensitivity) / specificity. In this case, it would be (1-0.6) / 0.8 = 0.5. This means that if the test result is negative, the odds of the patient having bowel cancer are halved.<br/><br/>The option <b>1.3 (1 dp)</b> is incorrect because this value suggests an increase in the odds of disease given a positive test result, which is not applicable here as we are discussing a negative test result.<br/><br/>The option <b>0.48</b> is also incorrect as it does not match with the calculation from the provided sensitivity and specificity values. It's important to note that LR- should always be less than 1, but above zero.<br/><br/>Similarly, <b>-0.2</b> is incorrect as likelihood ratios cannot be negative numbers. A negative likelihood ratio indicates a decrease in the probability of disease given a negative test result.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>0.3 (1 dp)</b> is incorrect as well because it does not align with our calculations based on given sensitivity and specificity values.<br/><br/>In conclusion, understanding how to calculate and interpret likelihood ratios can help clinicians understand how much a diagnostic test result will change the probability of a disease for their patient.<br/><br/></div>
