Nominal data, also known as categorical data, refers to data that can be divided into multiple categories but having no order or priority. Each category is unique and one cannot be considered higher or lower than another. The country of origin falls under this type of data as it simply categorises individuals based on their nation of origin without any inherent order or hierarchy.<br/><br/>Discussing the incorrect options:<br/><br/><b>Random</b> is not a type of data. It's a term used to describe a situation where each member of a set has an equal chance of being chosen. It doesn't apply here because we're discussing types of data, not methods for selecting data.<br/><br/><b>Ordinal</b> data are categories that have a natural order or ranking but the intervals between the ranks may not be equal. For example, educational level (e.g., primary school, secondary school, university) is ordinal because there's an inherent order (university education is higher than primary school education), but the 'distance' between these categories isn't uniform or measurable in any meaningful way.<br/><br/><b>Ratio</b> data are numerical values where both differences and ratios are meaningful. This kind of data has a true zero point which represents absence of the quantity (for example, age or height). Country of origin does not fit this description as it neither provides numerical value nor has a true zero point.<br/><br/><b>Interval</b> data are like ratio data but without a natural zero point. This means you can add and subtract, but multiplication and division don't make sense. An example would be temperature in Celsius: 0 degrees does not mean 'no temperature,' so while 30 degrees is hotter than 20 degrees, it's not 'twice as hot.' Again, country of origin does not meet these criteria as it's categorical rather than numerical.<br/><br/></div>
