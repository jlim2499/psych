Cronbach's alpha is a measure of internal consistency, that is, how closely related a set of items are as a group. It is considered to be a measure of scale reliability. A high value for Cronbachâ€™s alpha indicates good internal consistency of the items in the scale.<br/><br/><b>Cohen's kappa</b> is incorrect because it measures inter-rater reliability for qualitative (categorical) items. It calculates the degree of agreement in classification over that which would be expected by chance. It is not a measure of internal consistency.<br/><br/><b>Test-retest reliability</b> is also incorrect. This form of reliability uses the same test on two or more separate occasions to the same group of individuals. The scores from Time 1 and Time 2 can then be correlated in order to evaluate the test for stability over time. This does not provide information about the internal consistency of a test.<br/><br/><b>Logistic regression</b> is incorrect as it is not a measure of reliability or consistency at all, but rather, it's a statistical analysis model used to predict an outcome based on one or more predictor variables. Its purpose is to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>ANOVA</b>, or Analysis Of Variance, also does not measure internal consistency either. ANOVA provides a statistical test of whether two or more population means are equal, and therefore generalises t-test to more than two groups. ANOVAs are useful for comparing three or more means for statistical significance.<br/><br/></div>
