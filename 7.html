Which one of the following statements regarding the calculation of the correlation coefficient (r), is incorrect?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">May be used to predict systolic blood pressure for a given age</span></div><br/>The correct answer is '<b>May be used to predict systolic blood pressure for a given age</b>'. The correlation coefficient (r) measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables, in this case, age and systolic blood pressure. However, it does not allow us to predict an individual's systolic blood pressure based on their age. Correlation does not imply causation; hence, even if there's a strong correlation between these two variables, it doesn't mean that one can use the value of one variable (age) to accurately predict the other (systolic blood pressure). This would require further analysis such as regression.<br/><br/><b>A value of r greater than 0 implies a positive correlation between age and systolic blood pressure</b> is correct. A positive value of r indicates a direct or positive correlation between two variables - as one increases, so does the other.<br/><br/><b>If r = 0 then there is no linear correlation between systolic blood pressure and age</b> is also correct. An r-value of 0 signifies no linear relationship between the two variables being studied.<br/><br/><b>r may lie anywhere between -1 and 1</b> is true as well. The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, 0 indicates no correlation, and +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation.<br/><br/>The statement <b>Do not provide evidence of cause and effect</b> is accurate too because a statistical relationship based on correlational data cannot confirm causality. In other words, just because two variables are correlated does not mean that changes in one cause changes in the other.<br/></div>
