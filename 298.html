The standard error is a measure of how much the sample mean is expected to vary from the true population mean. It provides insight into the precision of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean.<br/><br/><b>The standard deviation is calculated by dividing the variance by the square root of the sample size</b>. This statement is incorrect. The standard deviation is actually the square root of the variance.<br/><br/><b>The units of variance are expressed as the same as the data set from which it is calculated</b>. This statement is incorrect. The units of variance are actually the square of the units of the data set. For example, if the data set is in metres, the variance will be in square metres.<br/><br/><b>The mean is the measure of dispersion used in skewed data</b>. This statement is incorrect. The mean is a measure of central tendency, not dispersion. Measures of dispersion include the range, variance, standard deviation, and interquartile range. In skewed data, the mean can be misleading as it is affected by outliers.<br/><br/><b>The interquartile range is the difference between the smallest and largest value</b>. This statement is incorrect. The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile) of a data set. It measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data, not the overall range.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/><br/>The standard error is crucial for understanding how close a sample mean is likely to be to the true population mean, making it an important measure in inferential statistics. The other options provided either incorrectly describe the measures of dispersion or confuse measures of central tendency with measures of dispersion.<br/></div>
