The screening test enables the early detection of Alzheimer's before symptoms arise. A study is conducted on the scheme and reports an increase in survival time and attributes this to the use of fish oils.<br/><br/>Which type of bias could account for the apparent increase in survival time?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Lead Time bias</span></div><br/>The most likely type of bias that could account for the apparent increase in survival time is 'Lead Time bias'.<br/><br/>Lead Time bias occurs when increased survival time is observed due to earlier detection of the disease rather than because of an actual therapeutic benefit. Since the screening test in the pilot scheme enables the early detection of Alzheimer's before symptoms arise, the duration from the diagnosis to death may appear longer simply because the diagnosis was made earlier, not necessarily because the fish oils have a therapeutic effect on survival.<br/><br/>Here's why the other biases listed are not as likely in this scenario:<br/><br/>Incidence-Prevalence bias: This occurs when the study preferentially selects individuals who have long-standing disease (prevalent cases), which may not reflect the experience of newly diagnosed individuals (incident cases). In the scenario provided, the bias is related to the timing of diagnosis rather than the mixture of incident and prevalent cases.<br/><br/>Ecological fallacy: This bias arises when conclusions about individual-level associations are drawn from group-level data. This doesn't apply here since the study in question is about individual patients who received early screening and fish oils.<br/><br/>Berkson's bias: Occurs in hospital-based studies when the selected study subjects are more likely to have two or more conditions than the general population, which is not the context provided in the scenario.<br/><br/>Work-up bias: This form of bias can happen when the decision to test for a condition (or the intensity of the investigation) is influenced by the presence of symptoms. However, in this scenario, the screening is applied to a subgroup regardless of symptom presence, thus work-up bias is less relevant.<br/></div>
