<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>The following extract contains information from a qualitative study on antidepressants. Which of the following techniques was used to assess validity by the researchers?<br/>Aims:<br/><br/>To understand patients experiences of this phenomenon.<br/><br/>Method:<br/><br/>Qualitative study, gathering data through individual interviews, a group interview and validation interviews; and searching patient websites for relevant posts.<br/><br/>Thirty-eight semi-structured individual interviews were conducted, as part of a continuous process of data gathering, data analysis and ongoing refinement of our understanding of emotional side-effects. Interviews were conducted by V.C., who introduced herself as a researcher from a team interested in depression, its treatments and their side-effects. Interviews were audio-recorded. Participants were asked to comment on their experiences, good and bad, of SSRIs; to comment specifically on adverse experiences; and finally to expand on emotional effects of SSRIs, including emotional blunting. As understanding increased, more specific questions were added.<br/><br/>A further series of 11 individual interviews were conducted with a subsample of participants, in order to validate the findings (respondent validation) and field test the draft questionnaire.<br/><br/>Results:<br/><br/>There was strong evidence that some people taking SSRIs experience significant emotional symptoms that they strongly attribute to their antidepressant. These emotional symptoms can be described within six key themes. A seventh theme represents the impact of these side-effects on everyday life, and an eighth represents participants reasons for attributing these symptoms to their antidepressant. Most participants felt able to distinguish between emotional side-effects of antidepressants and emotional symptoms of their depression or other illness.<br/><br/>Conclusions:<br/><br/>Emotional side-effects of SSRIs are a robust phenomenon, prominent in some peoples thoughts about their medication, having a demonstrable impact on their functioning and playing a role in their decision-making about antidepressant adherence.<br/><br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Member checking</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Member checking</b>. Member checking, also known as respondent validation, is a technique used in qualitative research to help improve the accuracy, credibility, validity, and reliability of the study. In this case, it was conducted through a series of 11 individual interviews with a subsample of participants to validate the findings from the initial interviews and field test the draft questionnaire. This process allows researchers to confirm that their understanding aligns with the participants' experiences and perceptions.<br/><br/><b>Triangulation</b> is incorrect because it refers to using multiple methods or data sources in qualitative research to develop a comprehensive understanding of phenomena. Triangulation could be data triangulation (using different sources of information), investigator triangulation (using several different researchers), theory triangulation (using different theoretical perspectives), or methodological triangulation (using more than one method to gather data). In this study extract, there is no mention of using multiple methods or sources for data gathering.<br/><br/><b>Bracketing</b> is also not correct. Bracketing in qualitative research involves identifying and setting aside preconceived beliefs and opinions about the phenomenon under investigation. The researcher attempts to take a neutral standpoint towards the data collected. There's no evidence from this extract that bracketing was used by V.C., who conducted the interviews.<br/><br/>The option <b>Reflexivity</b> is incorrect as well because reflexivity involves an ongoing process where researchers acknowledge and disclose their biases, assumptions, expectations, and experiences that may influence the research process. Reflexivity can enhance transparency and quality in qualitative research but there's no indication from this extract that reflexivity was applied during this study.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Content analysis</b>, which refers to a systematic coding and categorising approach used for exploring large amounts of textual information unobtrusively to determine trends and patterns of words used, themes in communication content frequency, intensity, direction, and context about the research question, is also not correct. The extract does mention themes in the results but it doesn't specify that content analysis was used as a method to derive these themes.<br/></div>
