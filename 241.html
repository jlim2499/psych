<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A study is proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new medication for Lewy Body Dementia. The study design group decides to perform a double-blinded randomised controlled trial. Which type of bias does double-blinding primarily aim to minimise?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Expectation bias</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Expectation bias</b>. Expectation bias, also known as observer-expectancy effect, occurs when a researcher's expectations directly influence the outcome of an experiment or study. In a double-blinded randomised controlled trial, both the patient and doctor are unaware of whether the patient is receiving the new medication or a placebo. This blinding helps to prevent expectation bias, as neither participant nor investigator can allow their expectations to influence the results.<br/><br/><b>Recall bias</b> is incorrect because it refers to inaccuracies in data collection that occur when participants remember past events inaccurately. This type of bias would not be directly addressed by blinding in a randomised controlled trial.<br/><br/><b>Verification bias</b> is also incorrect. Verification bias occurs when the decision to verify results (typically through more definitive or 'gold standard' testing) is influenced by initial test results. This generally applies to diagnostic tests rather than treatment interventions, and so would not be directly mitigated by blinding in this scenario.<br/><br/><b>Non-responder bias</b>, another incorrect option, refers to potential skewing of study results due to differences between individuals who choose (or are able) to participate in research and those who do not. While important for overall study validity, non-responder bias would not be directly impacted by blinding procedures.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Confounding bias</b>, while an essential consideration in any study design, is not specifically addressed through blinding procedures either. Confounding occurs when an external factor associated with both the exposure and outcome of interest distorts the perceived relationship between them. While blinding may help reduce confounding by ensuring equal distribution of confounders across treatment groups, it does not inherently control for their presence or impact on study outcomes.<br/></div>
