All adults (aged 18 and above) attending the clinic over a 3-month period were invited to participate. Each participant completed a one-time survey assessing symptoms of anxiety and depression using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), respectively.<br/><br/>The survey also collected demographic information, including age, gender, income level, and educational background. Clinic staff administered the survey to all patients during their visit, and participants completed it within the clinic waiting area. No follow-up assessments were conducted.<br/><br/>Results:<br/><br/>The study found that 30% of participants reported moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, and 25% reported moderate to severe symptoms of depression. Higher prevalence rates were observed in younger participants, women, and those with lower socioeconomic status.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Descriptive cross-sectional study</b> The correct answer is <b>Descriptive cross-sectional study</b>. A descriptive cross-sectional study involves assessing a population at a single point in time to identify the prevalence of certain conditions and their associations with other factors. In this study, participants attending a primary care clinic completed a one-time survey assessing symptoms of anxiety and depression and provided demographic data, with no follow-up. The design focuses on describing prevalence and demographic associations, making it a clear example of a descriptive cross-sectional study.<br/><br/><b>Randomised control study</b> is incorrect. A randomised control study would involve assigning participants randomly to intervention or control groups to evaluate the effect of a treatment. This study did not involve any intervention or randomisation, nor was it designed to test a treatment, so it does not fit the criteria for a randomised control trial.<br/><br/><b>Case-control study</b> is incorrect. A case-control study involves comparing individuals with a specific outcome (cases) to those without the outcome (controls) to assess past exposures or risk factors. In this study, there was no division into cases and controls; instead, it assessed the prevalence of anxiety and depression across a general population in a single time frame, characteristic of a cross-sectional study.<br/><br/><b>Prospective cohort study</b> is incorrect. A prospective cohort study follows a group of individuals over time, observing outcomes based on initial exposure status. This study did not involve any follow-up of participants but was conducted as a single survey, aligning with a cross-sectional rather than a cohort design.<br/><br/><b>Retrospective cohort study</b> is incorrect. A retrospective cohort study uses historical data to classify individuals by exposure and follow them to the present. This study was conducted prospectively in a single sitting, without historical data, making it unsuitable for a retrospective cohort classification.<br/><br/><b>Analytical cross-sectional study</b> is incorrect. Although similar to a descriptive cross-sectional study, an analytical cross-sectional study specifically focuses on identifying associations between variables and testing hypotheses. While this study did explore demographic associations with anxiety and depression, its primary purpose was to describe prevalence, making it more accurately a descriptive cross-sectional study.<br/><br/><b>Ecological study</b> is incorrect. An ecological study examines associations at the population or group level rather than individual-level data. This study gathered individual-level data from each participant, making it unsuitable for an ecological classification.<br/><br/><b>Qualitative study</b> is incorrect. A qualitative study explores subjective experiences, perceptions, and meanings, often using interviews or focus groups. This study used a quantitative survey to measure symptoms and associations, making it quantitative rather than qualitative.<br/><br/><b>Case series</b> is incorrect. A case series is a descriptive report of individuals with a specific condition, typically without a control group or comparison data. This study looked at a broader clinic population to assess prevalence and demographic patterns, not specific cases with a single condition, which is typical of a case series.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>176.</b></td><td>Aim:<br/><br/>The objective of this study was to determine the psychiatric risk factors for adolescent suicide.<br/><br/>Method:<br/><br/>Sixty-seven adolescent suicide victims were compared with 67 demographically matched community controls. Psychiatric disorder was assessed in suicide victims using a psychological autopsy protocol and in controls using similar semi-structured psychiatric interviews. Risk factors were quantified by use of the odds ratio (OR), that is, the relative frequency of the occurrence of a given condition in the suicides compared with the controls.<br/><br/>Results:<br/><br/>The most significant psychiatric risk factors associated with adolescent suicide were major depression (OR = 27.0), bipolar mixed state (OR = 9.0), substance abuse (OR = 8.5), and conduct disorder (OR = 6.0). Substance abuse was a more significant risk factor when comorbid with affective illness than when alone (OR = 17.0 versus 3.3). The majority of depressed suicide victims had a primary affective disorder (82%). A significant minority (31%) of depressed suicide victims had been depressed less than 3 months. Previous suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, and homicidal ideation also were associated with adolescent suicide.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Case-control study</b> The correct answer is <b>Case-control study</b>. A case-control study design involves comparing individuals with a particular outcome (cases) to a matched group without the outcome (controls) to identify risk factors associated with the outcome. In this study, adolescent suicide victims (cases) were compared with demographically matched controls to determine psychiatric risk factors for suicide, making it a clear example of a case-control study.<br/><br/><b>Randomised control study</b> is incorrect. A randomised control study randomly assigns participants to intervention or control groups to test the effects of a treatment. This study did not involve random assignment but instead matched cases and controls retrospectively to assess risk factors, which is characteristic of a case-control design.<br/><br/><b>Prospective cohort study</b> is incorrect. A prospective cohort study follows individuals over time based on their exposure status to see if they develop a specific outcome. This study did not follow participants prospectively but rather compared individuals who already had the outcome (suicide victims) with matched controls, which aligns with a case-control approach.<br/><br/><b>Retrospective cohort study</b> is incorrect. A retrospective cohort study identifies exposure groups based on historical records and then follows them forward to determine outcomes. In this study, the outcome (suicide) was already known, and the researchers looked back to assess psychiatric risk factors, which is more typical of a case-control design.<br/><br/><b>Analytical cross-sectional study</b> is incorrect. An analytical cross-sectional study assesses exposure and outcome at a single point in time. Here, researchers compared past psychiatric conditions between cases and controls, rather than taking a single-time assessment, which is not consistent with a cross-sectional approach.<br/><br/><b>Ecological study</b> is incorrect. An ecological study examines associations at a population or group level rather than individual-level data. This study looked at individual psychiatric risk factors among suicide victims compared to controls, so it does not fit an ecological design.<br/><br/><b>Qualitative study</b> is incorrect. A qualitative study uses methods like interviews to explore experiences and perceptions rather than quantifying risk factors with statistical measures like odds ratios. This study quantitatively analysed risk factors, making it quantitative rather than qualitative.<br/><br/><b>Descriptive cross-sectional study</b> is incorrect. A descriptive cross-sectional study observes a population at one point in time without comparing cases and controls. This study involved a comparison between suicide victims and controls, which aligns more with a case-control design.<br/><br/><b>Case series</b> is incorrect. A case series describes characteristics of a group with a specific condition, often without a comparison group or in-depth statistical analysis. This study compared suicide victims with controls and used odds ratios to quantify risk, distinguishing it from a case series.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>177.</b></td><td>Aim:<br/><br/>To determine whether refugees are at elevated risk of schizophrenia and other non-affective psychotic disorders, relative to non-refugee migrants from similar regions of origin and the Swedish-born population.<br/><br/>Method:<br/><br/>1 347 790 people born after 1 January 1984, who were born in Sweden to two Swedish-born parents (n=1 191 004; 88.4%) or were refugees (n=24 123; 1.8%) or non-refugee first generation migrants (n=132 663; 9.8%) granted residency in Sweden were identified from a national database.<br/><br/>We followed participants from their 14th birthday, or date of arrival in Sweden if later, until diagnosis of an ICD (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) non-affective psychotic disorder (F20-29), emigration, death, or 31 December 2011, whichever was sooner.<br/><br/>Results:<br/><br/>The crude incidence rate of non-affective psychotic disorders was 38.5 (95% confidence interval 37.2 to 39.9) per 100 000 person years in the Swedish-born population, 80.4 (72.7 to 88.9) per 100 000 person years in migrants, and 126.4 (103.1 to 154.8) per 100 000 person years in refugees. This corresponded to an absolute rate difference of 45.9 (19.0 to 72.9) per 100 000 person years in refugees compared with migrants, in addition to an extra 41.9 (33.7 to 50.1) cases per 100 000 person years in migrants compared with the Swedish-born population. Compared with the Swedish-born population, hazard ratios were 2.90 (95% confidence interval 2.31 to 3.64) in refugees and 1.75 (1.51 to 2.02) in migrants, after adjustment for age, sex, their interaction, disposable income, and population density. Refugees were 1.66 (1.32 to 2.09) times more likely to be diagnosed as having non-affective psychotic disorders than were migrants. These associations were more pronounced in men than women (likelihood ratio test P for interaction=0.001).<br/></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Prospective cohort study</b> The correct answer is <b>Prospective cohort study</b>. A prospective cohort study involves identifying a group of individuals and following them over time to observe outcomes based on initial exposure status. In this study, researchers followed a cohort of Swedish-born individuals, refugees, and non-refugee migrants to assess the incidence of non-affective psychotic disorders. Participants were tracked from their 14th birthday (or date of arrival in Sweden) until diagnosis, death, emigration, or the study end date, making this a classic example of a prospective cohort study.<br/><br/><b>Randomised control study</b> is incorrect. A randomised control study involves randomly assigning participants to intervention or control groups to test the effects of a treatment or exposure. This study did not randomly assign participants to refugee or non-refugee status; rather, it observed naturally occurring groups, making it observational rather than experimental.<br/><br/><b>Case series</b> is incorrect. A case series is a descriptive study design that involves a group of individuals with a particular outcome or condition, often without a comparison group or assessment of risk factors over time. This study compared different groups (refugees, non-refugee migrants, Swedish-born individuals) and measured outcomes, making it more complex than a case series.<br/><br/><b>Retrospective cohort study</b> is incorrect because it involves looking back at historical data to classify individuals by exposure and follow outcomes from the past up to the present. This study was prospective, as individuals were followed forward in time from a defined baseline.<br/><br/><b>Analytical cross-sectional study</b> is incorrect. An analytical cross-sectional study collects data at a single point in time to examine associations between variables. This study, however, followed participants over an extended period, tracking the incidence of psychotic disorders, which is characteristic of a cohort study rather than a cross-sectional design.<br/><br/><b>Ecological study</b> is incorrect. An ecological study examines associations between exposures and outcomes at a population or group level, not individual-level data. This study followed individual participants and assessed personal outcomes (diagnosis of psychotic disorders), making it unsuitable for an ecological classification.<br/><br/><b>Case-control study</b> is incorrect. A case-control study involves identifying individuals with a specific outcome (cases) and comparing them to individuals without the outcome (controls) to examine past exposures. This study followed participants prospectively and compared incidence rates across exposure groups, which aligns with a cohort design, not a case-control approach.<br/><br/><b>Qualitative study</b> is incorrect. A qualitative study explores experiences, perceptions, and meanings through methods like interviews or focus groups, often without quantitative outcome measures. This study quantitatively measured incidence rates of psychotic disorders, hazard ratios, and absolute risk differences, which are not features of qualitative research.<br/><br/><b>Descriptive cross-sectional study</b> is incorrect. A descriptive cross-sectional study involves observing a population at a single point in time without following them over a period. In contrast, this study followed participants longitudinally, assessing the incidence of psychotic disorders across multiple years, which characterises a cohort design rather than a cross-sectional one.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/></div>
