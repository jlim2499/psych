<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A study aims to investigate whether a new lipid-lowering therapy has a significant effect on patients' serum cholesterol levels. The serum cholesterol levels of a group of patients are measured before and after the therapy. The data for cholesterol levels is continuous and normally distributed. Which statistical test should be used to analyse the data?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Paired t-test</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Paired t-test</b>. The paired t-test is used when comparing means from the same group at two different time points (e.g., before and after treatment). In this scenario, each patient's serum cholesterol level before treatment is paired with their level after treatment, and the test evaluates whether the mean difference is statistically significant.<br/><br/>The 5 Steps:<br/><br/>1) Define the research question: Does the new lipid-lowering therapy significantly reduce serum cholesterol levels in patients?<br/>2) Establish the number of groups and their relationship: One group of patients is measured at two time points (before and after treatment), making the measurements paired.<br/>3) Identify the variables and data types: Independent variable: Time point (before vs after therapy). Dependent variable: Serum cholesterol level (continuous, normally distributed).<br/>4) Determine whether to use a parametric or non-parametric test: Since the data is continuous and normally distributed, a parametric test is appropriate.<br/>5) Select the appropriate statistical test: The paired t-test is the correct choice for analysing the mean difference in paired observations.<br/><br/>Explanations for Incorrect Options:<br/><br/><b>Pearson's test</b>: This measures the correlation between two continuous variables (e.g., cholesterol and age) and is not suitable for comparing means across time points within the same group.<br/><br/><b>Unpaired t-test</b>: This compares means between two independent groups. In this study, the measurements are paired (before and after treatment), so an unpaired t-test would not be appropriate.<br/><br/><b>Chi-squared test</b>: This test analyses relationships between categorical variables. Cholesterol levels are continuous, so the chi-squared test is not suitable.<br/><br/><b>Spearman test</b>: This is a non-parametric test for correlation between two variables. It is not used for comparing paired means.<br/></div>
