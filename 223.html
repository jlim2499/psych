Internal consistency is a recognised form of reliability, often used in psychological testing and measurement. It measures whether the items within a test are consistent with each other in assessing the same construct. For example, in ADHD assessment tools, internal consistency ensures that all items related to inattentiveness behave similarly, providing reliability in measuring this particular domain.<br/><br/><b>Face</b>: Face validity refers to how suitable a test or measurement appears to stakeholders and is not a recognised type of reliability. It relates more to the perception of the measure's effectiveness rather than its statistical properties or consistent outcomes.<br/><br/><b>Predictive</b>: Predictive validity measures how well a test predicts future outcomes, such as how well an ADHD assessment predicts future academic performance. While important in evaluation, it is a form of validity, not reliability.<br/><br/><b>Concurrent</b>: Concurrent validity assesses how well a test correlates with an existing measure at the same point in time. Similar to predictive validity, it relates to the accuracy of the test in measuring a construct but is not related to the consistency of measurement (reliability).<br/><br/><b>Criterion</b>: Criterion validity measures how well one test correlates with an external criterion or standard. This is another form of validity, not reliability, which focuses on whether the tool provides consistent measurements over time.<br/></div>
