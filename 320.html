<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>The Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Jarque-Bera tests are used to test for which of the following?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Normality</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Normality</b>. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Jarque-Bera tests are statistical tests used to assess whether a given data set follows a normal distribution. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test compares the cumulative distribution function of the sample data with that of the theoretical normal distribution, while the Jarque-Bera test examines skewness and kurtosis of the sample data to determine if it differs significantly from a normal distribution.<br/><br/><b>Correlation</b> is incorrect as these tests do not measure correlation. Correlation refers to the statistical relationship between two variables, typically measured by Pearson's correlation coefficient or Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. These coefficients provide information about both the strength and direction of the relationship, but they do not indicate if data follows a specific distribution.<br/><br/><b>Power</b> is also an incorrect option. Power in statistics refers to the probability that a test will correctly reject a false null hypothesis (i.e., it measures the testâ€™s ability to detect an effect if there is one). It is often evaluated using power analysis, which can be based on various distributions depending on context, but neither Kolmogorov-Smirnov nor Jarque-Bera tests are designed for this purpose.<br/><br/>The option <b>Significance</b> is not correct either. Significance testing involves determining whether an observed effect in a sample could have occurred due to sampling error alone. This usually involves calculating p-values using various types of t-tests, chi-square tests or ANOVA depending upon the nature and number of samples involved. However, significance does not imply that data follows any specific distribution.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>Precision</b> is incorrect as well because precision in statistics refers to how close repeated measurements or estimates are to each other - it's about repeatability and reproducibility. Precision can be assessed using methods like Bland-Altman analysis or calculating coefficients of variation, but it does not involve testing for normality in a data set.<br/></div>
