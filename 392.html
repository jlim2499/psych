<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>The following figure is taken from a study that assessed the validity of the 12-Item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in screening for the most common postnatal psychiatric morbidities (mood, anxiety and adjustment disorders). <br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><a class="fancybox" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb031b.png" rel="group"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb031.png"/></a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"><a class="fancybox lbmagglasslink" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb031b.png" rel="group"><img src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/>Which of the following can be correctly interpreted from the figure? <br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">The score for the 12-item GHQ for those with anxiety disorder showed results that were skewed to the left</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>The score for the 12-item GHQ for those with anxiety disorder showed results that were skewed to the left</b>. The boxplot for the GHQ-12 scores in the anxiety disorder group shows that the median is noticeably closer to the upper quartile than to the minimum value, suggesting a greater spread of scores on the lower end. This distribution is consistent with left (negative) skew, where a longer tail of lower scores is present despite most scores being high. While boxplots do not quantify skewness, they allow for visual inference, which in this case suggests that some individuals with anxiety had relatively low GHQ scores. Recognising skew is clinically relevant, as it may affect the selection of statistical tests and interpretations of screening tool performance, especially when using symptom scores like the GHQ in psychiatric assessment.<br/><br/><b>No patient that has no diagnosis will score more than 10 on the 12-item GHQ</b> is incorrect. The boxplot clearly shows outliers above 10 in the group without a psychiatric diagnosis. This reflects the known limitation of screening tools, where individuals without a clinical disorder may still score above cut-offs, reinforcing the need for clinical judgement when interpreting results.<br/><br/><b>Those with comorbid anxiety-depression had an interquartile range of approximately 8â€“27 on the EPDS</b> is incorrect. The EPDS boxplot for this group suggests an IQR ranging from about 12 to 21, not 8 to 27. The upper limit of 27 approaches the maximum possible score on the EPDS (30), and is well beyond the upper quartile shown.<br/><br/><b>The spread of the data for those with adjustment disorder was symmetrical on the 12-item GHQ</b> is incorrect. The adjustment disorder group on the GHQ plot shows slight asymmetry, with the median slightly shifted and a mild skew, rather than a clearly symmetrical distribution.<br/><br/><b>All results on the EPDS were significant</b> is incorrect. The figure contains only descriptive boxplots and does not include p-values, confidence intervals, or other statistical tests. Therefore, no conclusions about significance can be drawn from the visual alone.<br/></div>
