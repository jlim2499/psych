<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>The graph below shows the results of a meta-analysis of 5 different studies each testing the effect of a new antipsychotic on patients with schizophrenia.  The PANSS was used to assess the effect.<br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><a class="fancybox" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb004b.png" rel="group"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb004.png"/></a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"><a class="fancybox lbmagglasslink" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb004b.png" rel="group"><img src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/>Regarding the meta-analysis, which of the following is true?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Two of the five studies produced results which failed to achieve statistical significance</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Two of the five studies produced results which failed to achieve statistical significance</b>. In the forest plot, statistical significance is determined by whether the confidence interval crosses zero. In this case, two of the five studies (Studies A and B) have confidence intervals that include zero, meaning their results are not statistically significant. This is an important concept in psychiatry and clinical trials, as non-significant results do not provide strong evidence for an intervention's effectiveness. Recognising statistical significance in meta-analyses is crucial when interpreting research for evidence-based practice.<br/><br/><b>Study C had the narrowest confidence interval</b>: This is incorrect. The confidence interval for Study C is not the narrowest on the plot. Study D has the narrowest confidence interval, indicating the least variability and highest precision in its estimate. In clinical decision-making, studies with narrower confidence intervals are generally more reliable, as they indicate greater certainty about the effect size.<br/><br/><b>The analysis failed to produce a combined estimate that is statistically significant</b>: This is incorrect. The combined estimate (represented by the diamond) does not cross zero, indicating that the overall meta-analysis result is statistically significant. This suggests that, despite some individual studies lacking significance, the pooled data provide strong evidence that the intervention is effective. Clinicians should understand that meta-analysis strengthens conclusions by increasing statistical power.<br/><br/><b>Study B showed the greatest effect</b>: This is incorrect. Study B has the widest confidence interval and crosses zero, meaning it does not show a significant effect. Additionally, its point estimate does not demonstrate the largest effect size compared to other studies. In clinical practice, large but highly variable effects should be interpreted with caution, especially if they lack statistical significance.<br/><br/><b>Studies B and C showed change in favour of the intervention</b>: This is incorrect. While Study B suggest an effect in favour of the intervention, study C suggests the opposite, Neither studies provide statistically significant support for the intervention, as their confidence intervals includes zero. This distinction is crucial in evaluating psychiatric research, ensuring that only robust findings inform clinical guidelines and treatment recommendations.<br/></div>
