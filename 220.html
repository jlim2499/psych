<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is an analytic technique based on grounded theory?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Constant comparison</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Constant comparison</b>. Constant comparison is an analytic technique that originated from grounded theory. Grounded theory is a research method in which data collection and analysis occur simultaneously, with findings from data analysis guiding subsequent data collection. Constant comparison involves comparing new data to existing data as it is collected, allowing for the development of categories and theories that are 'grounded' in the actual data.<br/><br/><b>Bracketing</b> is not the correct answer as this term refers to a phenomenological research approach where researchers set aside their preconceptions about the phenomenon under investigation. It's used to reduce bias by separating personal experiences or beliefs that might influence the research process.<br/><br/><b>Triangulation</b>, another incorrect option, refers to the use of multiple methods or data sources in qualitative research to develop a comprehensive understanding of phenomena. Triangulation also has been viewed as a qualitative research strategy used to establish validity through cross verification from more than two sources.<br/><br/>The next incorrect option, <b>Content analysis</b>, is a systematic coding and categorising approach used for exploring large amounts of textual information unobtrusively to determine trends and patterns of words used, their frequency, their relationships, and the structures and discourses of communication.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Reflexivity</b>, while an important concept within qualitative research, isn't an analytic technique based on grounded theory either. Reflexivity involves researchers reflecting on how their social background, assumptions, positioning and behaviour impact all stages of the research process - from design to dissemination.<br/></div>
