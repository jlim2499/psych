This lack of correlation with an unrelated construct demonstrates:<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Divergent validity</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Divergent validity</b>. Divergent validity, also known as discriminant validity, refers to the degree to which a test does not correlate with measures of unrelated constructs. In this case, the test is designed to screen for autism and shows a lack of correlation with ADHD, which is a different construct. This lack of correlation demonstrates the test's ability to discriminate between autism and unrelated constructs like ADHD.<br/><br/><b>Convergent validity</b>: This refers to the degree to which a test correlates with other measures of the same or closely related constructs. For example, if a test for autism correlated strongly with other validated autism tests, it would demonstrate convergent validity. However, this does not apply to the lack of correlation with ADHD.<br/><br/><b>Content validity</b>: This refers to how well a test covers the entirety of the construct it is intended to measure. For instance, a test with strong content validity for autism would comprehensively assess all core aspects of autism, but this is unrelated to its ability to discriminate between autism and ADHD.<br/><br/><b>Criterion validity</b>: This refers to how well a test correlates with a specific criterion or outcome, such as diagnostic accuracy compared to a gold standard. While criterion validity evaluates how well the test performs overall, it does not directly address the lack of correlation with an unrelated construct like ADHD.<br/><br/><b>Face validity</b>: This refers to whether the test appears to measure what it claims to measure, based on subjective judgment. For example, if the test items look appropriate for assessing autism, it would demonstrate face validity. This is not related to the lack of correlation with ADHD.<br/></div>
