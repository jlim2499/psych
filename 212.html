Negative effect sizes favour the interventions used.<br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><a class="fancybox" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb015b.png" rel="group"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb015.png"/></a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"><a class="fancybox lbmagglasslink" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb015b.png" rel="group"><img src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/>How many studies included in the study achieved statistical significance in favour of the intervention?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">6</span></div><br/>Studies with confidence intervals that cross the line of effect (0) are not significant. For those studies where it is not clear if the confidence interval crosses the line, the exact intervals can be seen to the right.<br/><br/>The correct answer is <b>Six</b>. Out of the 13 studies represented in the forest plot, six studies show a statistically significant effect size in favour of the intervention (indicated by the confidence interval not crossing the zero line). These studies are Baker-Henningham 2005, Rahman 2008, Hughes 2009, Lara 2010, Mao 2012, and Gao 2012. Statistically significant results in these studies suggest that the interventions had a measurable and favourable impact on reducing common perinatal mental disorders in women from low- and middle-income countries.<br/><br/><b>Four</b>: This is incorrect because only six studies, not four, show statistically significant results in favour of the intervention. The error likely arises from underestimating the number of studies where the confidence intervals do not cross zero.<br/><br/><b>Eight</b>: This is incorrect because while eight studies may appear to have negative effect sizes, only six of these demonstrate statistical significance. Two of these studies have confidence intervals that cross zero, indicating that their results are not statistically significant.<br/><br/><b>Zero</b>: This is incorrect as there are clearly six studies with statistically significant results. This option would only be correct if none of the studies showed significance, which is not the case here.<br/><br/><b>Two</b>: This is incorrect because there are more than just two studies that achieve statistical significance. The option significantly underestimates the number of studies with significant results.<br/></div>
