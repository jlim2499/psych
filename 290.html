The mean potassium is 4.6 mmol/l with a standard deviation of 0.3 mmol/l. Which one of the following statements is correct?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">68.3% of values lie between 4.3 and 4.9 mmol/l</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>68.3% of values lie between 4.3 and 4.9 mmol/l</b>. This correctly reflects the property of the normal distribution where approximately 68.3% of the data lies within 1 standard deviation (SD) of the mean. Given that the mean potassium level is 4.6 mmol/l with an SD of 0.3 mmol/l, one SD below and above the mean are 4.3 to 4.9 mmol/l.<br/><br/><b>95% of values lie between 4.5 and 4.75 mmol/l</b>. This statement is incorrect because it misapplies the normal distribution rules. The interval given (4.5 to 4.75 mmol/l) is too narrow to include 95% of the values. For 95.4% of the values, you need to consider 2 SDs from the mean.<br/><br/><b>95.4% of values lie between 4.3 and 4.9 mmol/l</b>. This statement is incorrect because it describes the range that includes approximately 68.3% of the values, not 95.4%. For 95.4% of the values, you need to consider 2 SDs from the mean, which would be 4.0 to 5.2 mmol/l.<br/><br/><b>99.7% of values lie between 4.0 and 5.2 mmol/l</b>. This statement is incorrect. The range of 4.0 to 5.2 mmol/l includes approximately 95.4% of the values, not 99.7%. For 99.7% of the values, you need to consider 3 SDs from the mean, which would be 3.7 to 5.5 mmol/l.<br/><br/><b>68.3% of values lie between 4.5 and 4.75 mmol/l</b>. This statement is incorrect. The range given (4.5 to 4.75 mmol/l) is too narrow and does not accurately represent 1 SD from the mean. For 68.3% of the values, you need the range 4.3 to 4.9 mmol/l.<br/></div>
