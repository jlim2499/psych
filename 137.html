The term ANOVA stands for Analysis of Variance, which is a statistical method used to test differences between two or more means. It is used when comparing three or more groups of data to understand if there's a significant difference among them. The F statistic, named after Sir Ronald Fisher who developed the ANOVA, summarises how much variation occurs within each group compared to the amount of variation between different groups. If the 'between-group' variance is significantly larger than the 'within-group' variance, it suggests that there may be a significant difference between at least two of the group means.<br/><br/>The <b>Chi-squared test</b> is incorrect as this test provides a chi-square statistic, not an F statistic. Chi-squared tests are used in hypothesis testing and they're applicable when dealing with categorical data. They help to determine if there's a significant association between two categorical variables.<br/><br/>The <b>Student's t-test</b>, also known simply as t-test, gives a t-statistic, not an F statistic. This test compares two averages (means) and determines if they are different from each other. The t-test is most useful when you want to compare just two groups of data.<br/><br/><b>Mann Whitney U</b> test does not provide an F statistic either. It's a nonparametric test used to compare two sample ranks when the normal distribution assumption isn't met. It helps us understand whether the distributions of these two samples are identical or not without making any assumptions about their statistical distribution.<br/><br/><b>Wilcoxon's test</b>, similarly, doesn't yield an F statistic. This non-parametric statistical hypothesis test can be used when you cannot assume your sample data follows a normal distribution - it compares median values from different samples rather than means like in ANOVA or Studentâ€™s T-Test.<br/><br/></div>
