<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A doctor is conducting a study exploring the lived experiences of patients with chronic pain to understand how they manage their condition in daily life. She has conducted in-depth interviews with each participant and is analysing the transcripts to identify recurring themes. Given the subjective nature of the data and the potential for researcher bias, the doctor wants to ensure the validity of her findings.<br/>Which of the following techniques would be most suitable for ensuring validity in this study?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Bracketing</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Bracketing</b>. Bracketing is a technique in qualitative research used to manage researcher bias and enhance the validity of the findings. In qualitative studies, researchers often interact closely with participants and engage deeply with the data, which can make it challenging to separate personal beliefs, assumptions, or experiences from the interpretation process. Bracketing involves the researcher consciously setting aside or 'bracketing' these preconceptions to focus more objectively on the participants' perspectives.<br/><br/>In this scenario, the doctor is exploring the lived experiences of patients with chronic pain through in-depth interviews. Given the subjective nature of this data and the doctor’s potential personal beliefs or assumptions about chronic pain management, there is a risk that these pre-existing ideas could unconsciously influence the interpretation of the data. Bracketing would involve the doctor reflecting on their own views, setting them aside as much as possible, and approaching the analysis with an open mind. For example, the doctor might document their personal assumptions about chronic pain before beginning the analysis to become more aware of potential biases. By acknowledging and setting aside these biases, the doctor can ensure that the emerging themes and findings genuinely reflect the patients' experiences rather than the doctor’s interpretations.<br/><br/>In practical terms, bracketing can be done through reflective journaling, where the doctor regularly records thoughts, feelings, and potential biases throughout the research process. This can help the doctor maintain self-awareness and return to the data with a fresh perspective. Bracketing ultimately strengthens the study’s validity by ensuring that the findings are rooted in the participants' lived experiences rather than shaped by the researcher’s personal views.<br/><br/><b>Factor analysis</b>: Factor analysis is a statistical method used in quantitative research to identify underlying relationships between variables. It requires numerical data and is not applicable to qualitative studies focused on exploring subjective experiences.<br/><br/><b>Cronbach's alpha</b>: Cronbach's alpha is a statistical measure of internal consistency, typically used in quantitative research to assess the reliability of scales or questionnaires. It does not assess validity and is not relevant to qualitative research.<br/><br/><b>Content analysis</b>: Content analysis is a method for analysing qualitative data by identifying patterns and themes within text. While it is used in qualitative research, content analysis is a technique for data analysis rather than a method specifically for assessing validity. It does not address researcher bias or preconceptions.<br/><br/><b>Chi-square test</b>: The Chi-square test is a statistical test used in quantitative research to assess associations between categorical variables. It is not applicable in qualitative research, where the focus is on understanding experiences and meanings rather than statistical relationships.<br/></div>
