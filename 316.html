The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) uses an ordinal scale, which consists of ordered categories. In the BDI, each item is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3. The points are assigned according to the severity of depressive symptoms, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. The key feature of an ordinal scale is that while we can say that one score is higher than another, we cannot quantify the difference between the scores.<br/><br/><b>Nominal</b> scales are incorrect because they involve categories that do not have a natural order or ranking. Examples include gender (male or female), blood type (A, B, AB, O), or marital status (single, married, divorced). If the BDI used a nominal scale, it would simply categorise patients into groups without providing any information about symptom severity.<br/><br/><b>Ratio</b> scales are also incorrect because they not only provide an order but also have a consistent interval and an absolute zero point. This means that you can make meaningful statements about the ratios of measurements. Examples include age (e.g., a 20-year-old person is twice as old as a 10-year-old person) and weight. The BDI does not have these properties – for instance, we cannot say that a patient who scores 2 on an item is feeling twice as depressed as someone who scores 1.<br/><br/><b>Interval</b> scales are incorrect because while they provide ordered categories and consistent intervals between them like ratio scales do, they lack an absolute zero point. This means you can add and subtract values but cannot multiply or divide them meaningfully. Examples include temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit degrees: You can say that 30 degrees is hotter than 20 degrees by the same amount that 20 degrees is hotter than 10 degrees; however you cannot say that 30 degrees is twice as hot as 15 degrees. The BDI does not have consistent intervals – the psychological difference between scores of 0 and 1 may not be the same as the difference between scores of 2 and 3.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Qualitative</b> scales are incorrect because they involve non-numerical categories or levels, such as 'low', 'medium', and 'high'. While these categories can sometimes be ordered (e.g., low &lt; medium &lt; high), they do not provide any information about the magnitude of differences between levels. In contrast, the BDI uses numerical ratings to indicate symptom severity.<br/></div>
