<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which Bradford Hill criterion assesses whether a causal relationship aligns with known biological mechanisms?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Coherence</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Coherence</b>. Coherence refers to the alignment of an observed association with known biological, epidemiological, and clinical knowledge. This criterion strengthens the argument for causation by ensuring that the proposed relationship fits within the broader understanding of how biological mechanisms operate. For example, the known carcinogenic effects of tobacco smoke on lung tissue provide coherence to the causal link between smoking and lung cancer.<br/><br/><b>Strength</b>: Strength assesses the magnitude of the association (e.g., a higher relative risk suggests a stronger likelihood of causation). While strength supports causation, it does not evaluate biological plausibility.<br/><br/><b>Temporality</b>: Temporality requires that the cause precedes the effect. This is a fundamental criterion for causation, but it does not consider biological mechanisms.<br/><br/><b>Specificity</b>: Specificity evaluates whether a cause leads to a specific effect. While this can support causation, it is not related to whether the association aligns with biological knowledge. Many causes, such as smoking, lead to multiple outcomes, making this criterion less critical in some cases.<br/><br/><b>Direction</b>: Direction is part of Susserâ€™s criteria and focuses on whether the causal relationship follows a logical pathway. It overlaps with coherence but does not directly assess alignment with existing biological mechanisms.<br/></div>
