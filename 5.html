This is because in statistical hypothesis testing, a null hypothesis is rejected if the test statistic falls in the critical region. The critical region corresponds to the rejection of the null hypothesis at a certain significance level. If we are working with a 95% confidence interval and our hypothesised value does not lie within this interval, we can reject the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level. This means that there's less than a 5% chance that our observed data could have occurred under the null hypothesis.<br/><br/>On to discussing each of the incorrect answers:<br/><br/><b>The null hypothesis is void</b> - This option is incorrect because whether or not a null hypothesis can be rejected has nothing to do with it being 'void'. A null hypothesis is an initial claim that there's no statistical significance between two measured phenomena. It doesn't become 'void' until it's disproven by testing.<br/><br/><b>The probability of a type II error is equal to 0</b> - This option is also incorrect. A type II error occurs when we fail to reject a false null hypothesis (a 'false negative'). While reducing type II errors is important, having zero probability of such an error doesn't necessarily mean that we can reject the null hypothesis at any specific significance level.<br/><br/><b>The null hypotheses includes sampling error</b> - This option isn't accurate either. All hypotheses testing involves some degree of sampling error, as they are based on samples rather than entire populations. However, this fact alone doesnâ€™t provide enough evidence to reject a null hypothesis at any given significance level.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>A 95% confidence interval includes the hypothesised value of the parameter</b> - This statement would actually suggest that we fail to reject our null hypothesis at a 5% significance level. If our hypothesised value lies within the 95% confidence interval, it means that there's a high likelihood that this could be the true population parameter, and thus we wouldn't reject the null hypothesis.<br/></div>
