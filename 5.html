For example the word RED may be presented but it is written in blue. The subject is asked to state the colour of the text rather what is spelt by the letters as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>This test evaluates how able the subject is at making an appropriate response when given two conflicting signals. This ability is thought to stem from the anterior cingulate which lies between the right and left frontal lobes.<br/></div>
