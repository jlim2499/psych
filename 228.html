The dependent variable is the outcome that researchers measure in an experiment. It is called dependent because it is thought to depend on the manipulation of the independent variable(s).<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>They are those variables manipulated by the researcher: This is incorrect. The variables manipulated by the researcher are the independent variables, not the dependent variables.<br/><br/>They are always qualitative variables: This is incorrect. Dependent variables can be either qualitative or quantitative, depending on what is being measured.<br/><br/>They are affected by changes of controlled variables: This is incorrect. Controlled variables are those which are kept constant and not manipulated in an experiment. They should not affect the dependent variable.<br/><br/>In studies investigating treatments for diseases, the treatment is the dependent variable: This is incorrect. In such studies, the treatment would be the independent variable, as it is what is being manipulated to observe an effect on the outcome, which is the dependent variable.<br/></div>
