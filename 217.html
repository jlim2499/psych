<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following justifies the implementation of routine screening for dementia in older adults according to Wilson and Jungner’s criteria?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Dementia progresses through a predictable latent stage</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Dementia progresses through a predictable latent stage</b>. Dementia often has a gradual onset, progressing through stages like mild cognitive impairment before more severe symptoms appear. This predictable latent stage aligns with Wilson and Jungner’s screening criteria, as it provides an opportunity for early identification and intervention, which can delay progression and improve patient quality of life. For example, early intervention strategies, such as lifestyle modifications, cognitive therapy, or medication, may help slow disease progression, illustrating the clinical relevance of early screening.<br/><br/><b>Dementia is an untreatable condition</b>: This is incorrect. While there is currently no cure for dementia, there are treatments that can help manage symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients. Medications such as cholinesterase inhibitors can benefit individuals with Alzheimer's, and screening allows for timely intervention, which may enhance outcomes.<br/><br/><b>Dementia can be effectively treated in its late stages</b>: This is incorrect because treatments for dementia are generally more effective when started early. In the later stages of dementia, interventions are often less effective at managing symptoms or slowing progression, underscoring the importance of early screening and intervention.<br/><br/><b>Screening should occur only once in late adulthood</b>: This is incorrect. Wilson and Jungner’s criteria suggest that screening should be a continuous process, not a one-time event. Dementia screening may need to occur periodically as individuals age, given that cognitive decline can develop gradually over time.<br/><br/><b>There is no clear consensus on treatment approaches for dementia</b>: This is incorrect. There are recognised treatment pathways for dementia, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. A consensus on treatment exists, particularly for certain types of dementia like Alzheimer's disease, supporting the rationale for implementing screening programs.<br/></div>
