In an ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve, the y-axis represents sensitivity, while the x-axis represents 1 - specificity. Sensitivity, also known as true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified as such. It is a measure of how well a test can identify true positives.<br/><br/>The option <b>True negative rate</b> is incorrect because this is represented by specificity and not sensitivity. Specificity measures the proportion of negatives which are correctly identified, and it would be plotted on the x axis as 1 - specificity.<br/><br/>The option <b>1 - Sensitivity</b> is also incorrect. This would represent the false negative rate or Type II error (failing to reject a false null hypothesis). In an ROC curve, we plot sensitivity against 1 - specificity, not 1 - sensitivity.<br/><br/><b>False negative rate</b> is another incorrect choice for similar reasons to '1 - Sensitivity'. The false negative rate refers to the likelihood of a test incorrectly classifying a positive case as negative. This value does not form part of an ROC curve's axes; rather it influences the shape and position of the curve within its axes.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>Sensitivity - Specificity</b> is also not correct. An ROC curve plots sensitivity against 1- specificity, so subtracting these two values would not give you any meaningful measure in this context. <br/><br/>Remember that interpreting an ROC curve involves assessing how well a diagnostic test distinguishes between two states (e.g., disease present/absent), factoring in both its sensitivity and specificity at different threshold levels.<br/><br/></div>
