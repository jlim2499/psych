A box plot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, does not display mean values. Instead, it focuses on median values, quartiles, and potential outliers.<br/><br/><b>Skewness</b>: While a box plot does not directly provide skewness, it can suggest skewness by the asymmetry of the box and whiskers. If one side of the box is noticeably longer than the other or if the median is not centred within the box, it might indicate skewness. However, skewness is not explicitly displayed or quantified.<br/><br/><b>The significance of the difference in medians between groups</b>: This box plot is a notched box plot, which provides a visual indicator of the significance of the difference between medians. If the notches of two boxes do not overlap, it suggests that there is a statistically significant difference between the medians.<br/><br/><b>The 25th percentile values</b>: A box plot shows the 25th percentile (also known as the first quartile or Q1) as the bottom edge of the box. This value is an integral part of the box plot's representation of the data distribution.<br/><br/><b>The interquartile range of the data sets</b>: The interquartile range (IQR) is represented by the height of the box in a box plot. It is calculated as the difference between the 75th percentile (Q3) and the 25th percentile (Q1). The IQR provides information about the spread of the middle 50% of the data.<br/></div>
