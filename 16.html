<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is true regarding the Wechsler Adult Intelligence scale?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">It includes an assessment of working memory</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>It includes an assessment of working memory</b>. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) is a comprehensive measure of intelligence, which includes several different indices. One of these indices is indeed the Working Memory Index, which assesses an individual's ability to temporarily hold and manipulate information in conscious awareness. This index can provide valuable insight into a person's cognitive functioning and potential learning difficulties.<br/><br/>The statement <b>It scores intelligence out of 20</b> is incorrect. The WAIS uses a standard scoring system where the average score is set at 100, with most individuals scoring between 85 and 115. Scores are not capped at 20; in fact, they can theoretically range from 40 to 160.<br/><br/><b>It consists of 3 separate indices</b> is also incorrect. The WAIS actually consists of four separate indices: Verbal Comprehension Index, Perceptual Reasoning Index, Working Memory Index, and Processing Speed Index. These four indices together provide a Full Scale IQ score.<br/><br/>The option <b>A score of 100 suggests a severe learning difficulty</b> is not true either. As mentioned earlier, on the WAIS scale, a score of 100 represents average intelligence. A score significantly below this may suggest learning difficulties or intellectual disability, but it would depend on the specific cut-off points used by different diagnostic criteria.<br/><br/>Finally, the statement <b>It can be used to assess intelligence in children</b> is incorrect as well. While there are Wechsler scales designed for children (such as the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children or WISC), the WAIS itself is specifically designed for adults and older adolescents aged from 16 years old upwards.<br/><br/></div>
