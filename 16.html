<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is true regarding funnel plots?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Studies with a smaller standard error are located towards the top of the funnel </span></div><br/>The correct answer is '<b>Studies with a smaller standard error are located towards the top of the funnel</b>'. Funnel plots are a graphical tool used in meta-analyses to assess the presence of publication bias. In these plots, each study is represented by a dot, with the effect size (or outcome measure) plotted on the x-axis and the standard error on the y-axis. Studies with smaller standard errors (indicating larger sample sizes and therefore more precise estimates) are indeed located towards the top of the funnel.<br/><br/>The statement '<b>The standard error is plotted on the x-axis</b>' is incorrect. In funnel plots, it's customary to plot the effect size or outcome measure on the x-axis and the precision of each study's estimate (usually represented by its standard error) on the y-axis.<br/><br/>'<b>Funnel plots should not be used for continuous outcome measures</b>' is also incorrect. Funnel plots can be used for both dichotomous and continuous outcomes. The type of outcome doesn't affect their utility in detecting potential publication bias.<br/><br/>Regarding '<b>They allow for the visual inspection of attrition bias</b>', this too is incorrect. Attrition bias refers to systematic differences between groups in withdrawals from a study or 'dropouts'. While important, this type of bias isn't assessed using funnel plots; they're primarily used to detect publication bias.<br/><br/>Finally, '<b>Funnel plots should not be used in meta-analyses</b>' is untrue. On contrary, funnel plots are particularly useful in meta-analyses as they provide an intuitive visual method for assessing possible publication bias across multiple studies included in such analyses.<br/><br/></div>
