<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following statistical tests compares the variability within groups to the variability between groups to determine if there are significant differences among the group means?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">ANOVA</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>ANOVA</b>. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) compares the variability within groups to the variability between groups to determine if there are statistically significant differences in means across multiple groups. It is especially useful in scenarios where there are more than two groups. For example, if you wanted to compare anxiety scores between three therapy types (CBT, mindfulness, and psychodynamic therapy), ANOVA would be appropriate.<br/><br/><b>Mann Whitney U</b> is incorrect because it is a non-parametric test used to compare the medians of two independent groups when the data is not normally distributed. It does not analyse variances or allow for comparisons of more than two groups.<br/><br/><b>Paired t-test</b> is incorrect because it is used for comparing the means of two related groups (e.g., pre- and post-treatment scores for the same participants). It does not compare within-group and between-group variances.<br/><br/><b>Chi-squared test</b> is incorrect because it is designed to evaluate associations between categorical variables, not continuous data. It does not analyse variance or differences in group means.<br/><br/><b>Independent t-test</b> is incorrect because it compares the means of two independent groups, but it does not allow for comparisons of more than two groups or consider variability within and between groups simultaneously.<br/></div>
