During peer review of the research, this link is challenged by the fact that the temporal relationship between to the two has not been proven. What form of validity has been brought into question? </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Internal validity</b> <br/>The correct answer is <b>Internal validity</b>. Internal validity is concerned with the accuracy of conclusions about cause and effect. In this scenario, questioning the temporal relationship between the new designer drug and psychosis challenges whether the drug can truly be considered the cause of the psychosis, as proving causation requires demonstrating that the cause precedes the effect. Without this temporal proof, the causal link is speculative, making the internal validity of the study questionable. Clinically, this is crucial as it directly influences treatment approaches and policy decisions regarding the drug's safety and regulation.<br/><br/><b>Content validity</b>: This refers to the extent to which a measure represents all facets of a given construct. It does not directly relate to the issue of cause and effect, but rather the comprehensiveness of the measures used in the research. In this case, the challenge is not about the comprehensiveness of the representation of psychosis or drug effects but the causation claim itself.<br/><br/><b>Concurrent criterion validity</b>: This involves the correlation of a measure with an outcome assessed at the same time. The challenge raised does not concern the simultaneous measurement but the sequential relationship necessary to establish causality.<br/><br/><b>Face validity</b>: This is the most basic form of validity, where the measure appears effective in terms of the content of the construct it intends to measure. Face validity does not address the deeper issue of whether the correct temporal relationship has been established.<br/><br/><b>Divergent construct validity</b>: This type of validity tests whether concepts or measurements that are supposed to be unrelated are, in fact, unrelated. This form of validity is not relevant here, as the concern is not about distinguishing this drug’s effects from unrelated constructs.<br/><br/><b>Convergent construct validity</b>: This assesses whether measures that should be related, are indeed related. Like divergent validity, it is not pertinent to the current challenge as it doesn’t deal with the sequence of events necessary to establish causation.<br/><br/><b>Predictive criterion validity</b>: This involves the ability of a measure to predict an outcome in the future. The issue raised during peer review pertains to the sequence of drug use and onset of psychosis, not its predictive capacity.<br/><br/><b>External validity</b>: External validity relates to the generalisability of the findings beyond the specific settings, groups, or time frames of the initial study. While important, it does not address the causal relationship questioned in the peer review.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>258.</b></td><td>A PhD student conducted a small study which demonstrated that a new form of psychological therapy successfully alleviated symptoms of depression. They therefore made a claim in a review article that the new therapy is successful in treating depression. They were criticised for making this claim as the therapy had not been widely tested and so the results may not be generalisable. What form of validity was challenged?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>External validity</b> The correct answer is <b>External validity</b>. External validity refers to the degree to which the results of a study can be generalised to other contexts, populations, and settings. The criticism that the results of the therapy may not be generalisable beyond the small study group directly challenges the external validity. In clinical practice, generalisability is crucial as it determines whether a therapy that is effective in a controlled, limited setting can be effectively applied across a broader population, including various demographic and clinical backgrounds.<br/><br/><b>Content validity</b>: This form of validity examines whether an instrument or test covers a representative sample of the domain of knowledge or behaviour it is supposed to assess. It is not pertinent here, as the criticism was not about the scope of what was being measured but about the broader applicability of the findings.<br/><br/><b>Concurrent criterion validity</b>: This involves assessing whether a test correlates well with a measure taken at the same time. The challenge in the scenario does not concern simultaneous measurements or correlations but the applicability of the findings to a wider population.<br/><br/><b>Face validity</b>: Face validity pertains to whether a test appears effective in terms of what it is intended to measure at face value, rather than whether findings can be generalised. Thus, it is not relevant to the criticism faced by the PhD student.<br/><br/><b>Divergent construct validity</b>: Divergent construct validity checks if measures that are not supposed to be related are indeed distinct. The criticism related to generalisability does not fall within this scope.<br/><br/><b>Convergent construct validity</b>: This type of validity tests if measures that are supposed to be related are indeed related. Like divergent validity, this does not address the generalisability of the therapy’s effectiveness.<br/><br/><b>Predictive criterion validity</b>: This validity measures whether a test predicts future outcomes effectively. The issue raised does not involve predictions but whether the results can be applied broadly.<br/><br/><b>Internal validity</b>: Internal validity concerns the correctness of conclusions about cause and effect within the study conducted. While important, the criticism in this case centres not on the causal relationship within the study, but on the applicability of these results to a broader context.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>259.</b></td><td>The Royal College of Psychiatrists decides to reduce the length of each membership exam by reducing the areas that are examined. They decide to remove all questions on pharmacology as they believe that a candidate who scores highly on other areas would probably also have a good knowledge of pharmacology. Which type of validity would be compromised by this approach?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td> Content validity The correct answer is <b>Content validity</b>. Content validity refers to the extent to which a test measures all aspects of the construct it intends to assess. By removing all questions on pharmacology from the exam, the Royal College of Psychiatrists would be compromising the content validity of the membership exam because pharmacology is a fundamental area of knowledge that is essential for psychiatry. This reduction would mean that the exam no longer comprehensively covers the necessary breadth of knowledge required to practice as a psychiatrist, thus failing to assess all relevant content areas comprehensively.<br/><br/><b>External validity</b>: This type of validity concerns the generalisability of the test findings to other settings, groups, or times. Removing pharmacology questions from the exam does not directly impact external validity as this modification does not affect how exam results are applied outside the testing environment.<br/><br/><b>Concurrent criterion validity</b>: This involves the correlation of a test measure with a standard assessment conducted at the same time. The decision to remove pharmacology questions is unrelated to how the test's results might correlate with other simultaneous measures.<br/><br/><b>Face validity</b>: Face validity assesses whether a test appears effective at face value for what it is supposed to measure. While important, removing pharmacology might affect how stakeholders view the exam's thoroughness but does not directly impact face validity as it is more about perceptions than the actual breadth of content.<br/><br/><b>Divergent construct validity</b>: This validity checks whether measures intended to not be related are indeed unrelated. This form of validity is not applicable to the decision about exam content reduction as it does not deal with the relationships between different knowledge areas.<br/><br/><b>Convergent construct validity</b>: This assesses whether different measures that are supposed to be related indeed show a relationship. The removal of pharmacology questions does not pertain to convergent validity, which would be more concerned with the relationship between similar constructs being measured.<br/><br/><b>Predictive criterion validity</b>: This refers to the ability of a test to predict future outcomes based on test scores. The removal of pharmacology questions impacts the breadth of the subject matter covered but does not directly relate to how well the exam predicts future professional competence on its own.<br/><br/><b>Internal validity</b>: Internal validity involves the correctness of conclusions drawn from the study data, focusing on cause and effect. The decision to exclude an entire subject area from the exam affects content representation but not the internal causal relationships being tested within the exam context.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/></div>
