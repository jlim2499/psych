<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>An example of opportunity cost in healthcare is:<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Choosing between funding a new MRI machine or hiring additional staff</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Choosing between funding a new MRI machine or hiring additional staff</b>. Opportunity cost refers to the value of the next best alternative that is forgone when a decision is made. In this example, investing in one resource (an MRI machine) means giving up the opportunity to allocate those funds to hire additional staff. This concept is crucial in healthcare resource allocation, where budgets are finite, and trade-offs must be carefully considered.<br/><br/><b>Billing patients for missed appointments</b>: This is incorrect. While missed appointments may represent a financial loss, billing patients does not involve an explicit trade-off or decision between two alternative uses of resources, which is central to opportunity cost.<br/><br/><b>Investing in technology to improve efficiency</b>: This is incorrect. Although this is an example of resource allocation, the question does not specify what alternative is being forgone, which is necessary to illustrate opportunity cost.<br/><br/><b>Allocating funds based on patient satisfaction scores</b>: This is incorrect. While allocating funds based on satisfaction scores involves prioritisation, it does not directly highlight the trade-off between two competing uses of resources, as required to demonstrate opportunity cost.<br/><br/><b>Reducing the length of hospital stays to save money</b>: This is incorrect. Reducing hospital stays is an efficiency measure, but it does not explicitly demonstrate a trade-off between two alternative resource uses, which defines opportunity cost.<br/></div>
