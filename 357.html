<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>In a study comparing a drug versus a placebo, you believe that the drug will produce a larger number of side-effects.  When asked about the projected relative risk of side-effects occurring in the group receiving the drug, what would you estimate it to be?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">&gt;1</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>&gt;1</b>. A relative risk (RR) greater than 1 indicates that the group receiving the drug has a higher likelihood of experiencing side effects compared to the placebo group. In clinical studies, an RR greater than 1 suggests an increased risk associated with the treatment, which aligns with the expectation that the drug would produce more side effects than the placebo. Understanding relative risk is essential in assessing the safety profile of medications in psychiatry and other medical fields.<br/><br/><b>1</b>: A relative risk of 1 indicates no difference in the risk of side effects between the drug and placebo groups, meaning the drug does not increase or decrease the likelihood of side effects compared to placebo. This would not match the expectation that the drug would cause a higher rate of side effects.<br/><br/><b>&lt;1</b>: A relative risk less than 1 would imply a protective effect, where the drug group experiences fewer side effects than the placebo group. This is opposite to the expectation in this scenario, as it suggests the drug reduces side effect risk, which is not what the question implies.<br/><br/><b>Zero</b>: A relative risk of zero would mean that there is no risk of side effects in the drug group, which is not a feasible or realistic value in practice. Zero risk would imply the drug entirely prevents side effects, which is highly unlikely in clinical settings.<br/><br/><b>-1</b>: A relative risk cannot be a negative value, as relative risk represents a ratio of probabilities, which are always positive or zero. A negative value would not make sense in this context, as it implies an impossible scenario in which risk is below zero.<br/></div>
