A well known example is carrying matches and lung cancer.  People who have lung cancer are more likely to smoke and therefore more likely to carry matches, but carrying matches does not cause lung cancer.<br/><br/>Confounding can be addressed in the design and analysis stage of a study.  The main method of controlling confounding in the analysis phase is stratification analysis.  <br/><br/>The main methods used in the design stage are listed below.<br/><br/><ul><li>Matching (e.g. By age and gender)</li><li>Randomization</li><li>Restriction of participants (e.g. If watching TV is a known confounder then restrict participants to ones who don't watch TV)</li></ul><br/>The following table illustrates the main types of bias.<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid1"><thead><tr><th>Main type</th><th>Sub types</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Selection bias<br/><br/>(when selected sample is not a representative sample of reference population)</td><td>Loss to follow up bias: takes place in cohort studies when follow up cases are lost continuously. Lost cases may have something in common resulting in an unrepresentative sample.<br/><br/>Disease spectrum bias (aka case-mix bias): this can occur when a treatment is studied in more severe forms of a disease. Such results may then not apply to mild forms of the disease.<br/><br/>Sampling bias: where the subjects are not representative of the population. This may be due to volunteer bias (aka referral bias). An example of volunteer bias would be a study looking at the prevalence of Chlamydia in the student population. Students who are at risk of Chlamydia may be more, or less, likely to participate in the study.<br/><br/>Participation bias (Non-response bias): Those who participate may have shared characteristics resulting in a unrepresentative sample.<br/><br/>Incidence-Prevalence bias (Survival bias, Neyman bias): Occurs in case-control studies and is attributed to selective survival among the prevalent cases (i.e. mild, clinically resolved, or fatal cases being excluded from the case group).    <br/><br/>Exclusion bias: Occurs when certain patients are excluded for example if they are considered ineligible.<br/><br/>Publication or Dissemination bias: Many studies may not be published. This may be due to the fact that papers with positive results, and large sample sizes are more likely to get published.<br/><br/>Citation bias: Articles of high citation are easy to reach and have higher chance to be entered into a given  study.<br/><br/>Berkson's bias (aka admission rate bias): Berkson's bias is a type of selection bias. It can arise when the sample is taken not from the general population, but from a subpopulation. It was first recognised in case control studies when both cases and controls were sampled from a hospital rather than from the community.</td></tr><tr><td>Information bias<br/><br/>(when gathered information about  exposure, outcome or both is not correct and there was  an error in measurement)</td><td>Detection bias: This can occur when exposure can influence diagnosis. For example women taking an oral contraceptive will have more frequent cervical smears than women who are not on the pill and so are more likely to have cervical cancer diagnosed (if they actually have it). Thus, in a case-control study that compared women with cervical cancer and a control group, at least part of any higher pill consumption rates amongst the former group may be due to this effect.<br/><br/>Recall bias: In retrospective studies where participants are asked to remember their past exposure to risk factors, it is likely that cases will have thought more about what factors in their past may have caused a disease than controls will have. Controls are therefore less likely to remember an exposure because they don't link it to any disease process, which may skew the results.<br/><br/>Lead Time bias: Lead time is the period between early detection of disease and the time of its usual clinical presentation. When evaluating the effectiveness of the early detection and treatment of a condition, the lead time must be subtracted from the overall survival time of screened patients to avoid lead time bias. Otherwise early detection merely increases the duration of the patients' awareness of their disease without reducing their mortality or morbidity. Numerous cancer screening procedures were thought to improve survival until lead time bias was addressed.<br/><br/>Interviewer/Observer bias: Interviewer or observer knowledge about in-question hypothesis and disease    or/and exposure can take effect on collection and registry of data.<br/><br/>Verification and work-up bias: This is a type of bias in which the results of a diagnostic test affect whether the gold standard procedure is used to verify the test result. It is more likely to occur when a preliminary diagnostic test is negative because many gold standard tests can be invasive, expensive, and carry a higher risk.<br/><br/>Hawthorn effect: This can occur when participants alter their usual behaviour due to their awareness that they are being studied.<br/><br/>Ecological fallacy: This can occur when conclusions about individuals are based only on analyses of group data.<br/><br/>Expectation bias (Pygmalion effect): Only a problem in non-blinded trials. Observers may subconsciously measure or report data in a way that favours the expected study outcome.<br/><br/>Late-look bias: Gathering information at an inappropriate time e.g. studying a fatal disease many years later when some of the patients may have died already.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div>
