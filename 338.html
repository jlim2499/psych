Cumulative incidence, also known as the risk or attack rate, is a measure of disease frequency that calculates the number of new cases of a disease in a population over a specified time period. It is usually used with fixed populations where the denominator does not change over time. This makes it particularly useful for short-term studies and outbreaks.<br/><br/>Discussing the incorrect options:<br/><br/><b>The numerator in the incidence rate is the number of existing cases of a disease</b> - this statement is incorrect. The numerator in the incidence rate represents new cases that occur during a specified time period, not existing cases. Existing or prevalent cases are used to calculate prevalence, not incidence.<br/><br/><b>The incidence rate is easier to calculate than the cumulative incidence</b> - this statement isn't necessarily true. Both measures have their own complexities and challenges when calculating. The incidence rate requires accurate information on both new cases and person-time at risk which can be difficult to obtain, especially in large or mobile populations. On the other hand, cumulative incidence requires knowledge about all individuals at risk, which can also be challenging if there's loss to follow-up.<br/><br/><b>The denominator in the cumulative incidence is the person-time of observation in candidate population</b> - this statement confuses cumulative incidence with incidence rate. The denominator for cumulative incidence is simply the total number of people at risk at the beginning of a study period whereas for an incidence rate it would be person-time at risk during that period.<br/><br/><b>The incidence rate is synonymous with the incidence proportion</b> - this statement is incorrect because these terms refer to different measures of disease frequency. Incidence proportion (or cumulative incidence) refers to new cases divided by total population at risk over a specific time period while an incident rate refers to new cases divided by person-time at risk during that same period.<br/><br/></div>
