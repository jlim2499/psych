We sought to gain a better understanding of barriers to diagnosis and entering treatment for depression in primary care. <br/><br/>Methods: <br/><br/>We conducted and analyzed interviews with 15 subjects currently being treated for depression recruited from primary care clinics in an academic medical center and an academic public hospital. We asked about experiences with being diagnosed with depression and starting treatment, focusing on barriers to diagnosis, subject understanding of depression, and information issues related to treatment decisions.<br/><br/>Subjects were recruited by posting flyers in primary care clinics affiliated with the University of Washington Medical Center, an academic medical center, and at Harborview Medical Center, a public/teaching hospital affiliated with the University of Washington. We advertised for persons who had been diagnosed with depression within the past year. Persons who had been diagnosed with depression, spoke English, and were able to give informed consent were eligible to participate in the study. Recruitment ended once 15 participants had responded.  This study was approved by the University of Washingtons Human Subjects Institutional Review Board. <br/><br/>Results: <br/><br/>Subjects reported many visits to primary care practitioners without the question of depression being raised. The majority had recurrent depression. Many reported that they did not receive enough information about depression and its treatment options. In the majority of cases, practitioners decided the course of treatment with little input from the patients. <br/><br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Convenience sampling</span></div><br/>Why 'Convenience sampling' is correct:<br/><br/>Convenience sampling is a non-probability sampling method where participants are selected based on ease of access and availability. In the study described, subjects were recruited by posting flyers in primary care clinics, which means the researchers used a method that was most convenient for them to obtain participants. They did not apply a strategy to ensure that every individual with depression had an equal chance of being included in the study.<br/><br/>Why the other options are incorrect:<br/><br/>'Purposive sampling': This involves selecting individuals who meet particular criteria. While the study did seek individuals diagnosed with depression, the method of recruitment was not targeted or purposeful beyond the basic criteria; it was based on who responded to the flyers.<br/><br/>'Stratified sampling': This method involves dividing the population into subgroups (strata) and then taking a random sample from each stratum. There is no indication that the researchers stratified their sample; they simply recruited whoever responded.<br/><br/>'Quota sampling': Similar to stratified sampling, but not random. Researchers decide how many people to sample from each subgroup. The description does not indicate that any quotas were set for different subgroups within the population.<br/><br/>'Simple random sampling': This would involve every individual in the population having an equal chance of being included in the sample, which was not the case here since the sample depended on who saw the flyers and responded.<br/></div>
