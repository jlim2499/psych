<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A new screening test is developed for Parkinson's disease. It is a blood test which detects a protein; the higher the level of the protein, the more likely a patient is to have the condition. If the cut-off for a positive test is increased, which one of the following will also be increased?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Specificity</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Specificity</b>. Specificity refers to the ability of a test to correctly identify those without the disease. If we increase the cut-off for a positive test, we are essentially making our criteria for a positive result more stringent. This will reduce the number of false positives (people who do not have Parkinson's but test positive), thereby increasing the specificity.<br/><br/><b>The p value</b> is incorrect as it is a statistical term used in hypothesis testing to determine if there is a significant difference between groups or an association between variables. It does not directly relate to changes in cutoff values for diagnostic tests.<br/><br/><b>Likelihood ratio for a negative test result</b> is also incorrect. The likelihood ratio for a negative test result tells us how much less likely it is that someone with a negative test has the disease compared to someone chosen randomly from the general population. Increasing the cut-off level would lead to fewer true negatives and more false negatives, thereby decreasing this ratio rather than increasing it.<br/><br/><b>Sensitivity</b> is another incorrect option. Sensitivity refers to how well a test identifies true positives (those who actually have Parkinson's). By raising the threshold for what constitutes a 'positive' result, we may miss some individuals who do have Parkinson's but at lower protein levels - thus reducing sensitivity, not increasing it.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>Negative predictive value</b> would also not increase with an increased cut-off point for positivity in this screening test. Negative predictive value refers to how likely it is that someone with a negative result truly does not have the disease. As we raise our cut-off point, we are likely to classify more patients as 'negative', including some who actually do have Parkinson's (false negatives). This would decrease our negative predictive value because amongst those testing negative, there would be more people who actually do have Parkinson's.<br/><br/></div>
