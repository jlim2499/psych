What is the odds ratio (to the nearest whole number) of having suffered childhood physical abuse for patients with dissociative disorders compared to those without dissociative disorders.<br/>Objective:<br/><br/>The purpose of the study was to assess the prevalence of DSM-IV dissociative disorders in an inner-city outpatient psychiatric population.<br/><br/>Method:<br/><br/>Subjects were 231 consecutive admissions (84 men and 147 women, mean age=37 years) to an inner-city, hospital-based outpatient psychiatric clinic. The subjects completed self-report measures of dissociation (Dissociative Experiences Scale) and trauma history (Traumatic Experiences Questionnaire). Eighty-two patients (35%) completed a structured interview for dissociative disorders (Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule).<br/><br/>Results:<br/><br/>The 82 patients who were interviewed did not differ significantly on any demographic measure or on the self-report measures of trauma and dissociation from the 149 patients who were not interviewed. Twenty-four (29%) of the 82 interviewed patients received a diagnosis of a dissociative disorder. Dissociative identity disorder was diagnosed in five (6%) patients. Of the 82 respondents who completed the Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule, 24 were diagnosed with a dissociative disorder and 58 were not. Of those with dissociative disorders, childhood physical abuse was reported in 17 (71%) and was denied in seven (29%). Of those without dissociative disorders, childhood physical abuse was reported in 17 (29%) and was denied in 41. Chart review revealed that only four (5%) patients in whom a dissociative disorder was identified during the study had previously received a dissociative disorder diagnosis.<br/><br/>Conclusions:<br/><br/>Dissociative disorders were highly prevalent in this clinical population and typically had not been previously diagnosed clinically. The high prevalence of dissociative disorders found in this study may be related to methodological factors (all patients were offered an interview rather than only those who had scored high on a screening self-report measure) and epidemiological factors (extremely high prevalence rates for childhood physical and sexual abuse were present in the overall study population).<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">6</span></div><br/>The odds ratio (OR) for having suffered childhood physical abuse for patients with dissociative disorders compared to those without dissociative disorders is calculated using the provided study data:<br/><br/>There were 24 patients diagnosed with dissociative disorders.<br/>Out of those, 17 reported childhood physical abuse.<br/>Therefore, 7 patients with dissociative disorders did not report childhood physical abuse (24 - 17 = 7).<br/>There were also 58 patients without dissociative disorders.<br/>Out of those, 17 reported childhood physical abuse.<br/>Thus, 41 patients without dissociative disorders did not report childhood physical abuse (58 - 17 = 41).<br/>The OR is the ratio of the odds of exposure in the case group (with the condition) to the odds of exposure in the control group (without the condition):<br/><br/>OR = Odds of exposure in cases / Odds of exposure in controls<br/><br/>For this study:<br/><br/>OR = Odds of having suffered childhood physical abuse in patients with dissociative disorders / <br/>Odds of having suffered childhood physical abuse in patients without dissociative disorders<br/><br/>OR = (17/7) / (17/41)<br/>OR = (17x41) / (7x17)<br/>OR = 41 / 7<br/>OR = 5.857<br/><br/>When rounded to the nearest whole number, the OR is 6.<br/><br/>Therefore, the correct answer is '6', which indicates that patients with dissociative disorders are approximately six times more likely to have reported childhood physical abuse compared to those without dissociative disorders.<br/></div>
