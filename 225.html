The arrow labelled 1 points to the highest value within the range of the data for sample 4. This is represented by the top whisker of the box plot. The end of the whisker is not always the highest value but in this case it is as there are no outliers above it.<br/><br/>Explanation of Other Options:<br/><br/><b>Interquartile range</b> is incorrect. The interquartile range (IQR) is represented by the box itself, which spans from the first quartile (Q1) to the third quartile (Q3). The arrow labelled 1 points to the highest value, not the IQR.<br/><br/><b>Lowest value</b> is incorrect. The lowest value is represented by the bottom whisker of the box plot, not the top whisker where arrow 1 is pointing.<br/><br/><b>Q4</b> is incorrect. Quartile 4 (Q4) is not a standard term used in describing box plots. Typically, box plots use Q1 (first quartile), Q2 (median), and Q3 (third quartile). The term Q4 might be confused with the highest value, but it is not correct terminology for box plots.<br/><br/><b>Variance</b> is incorrect. Variance is a measure of the spread of data points around the mean, not something directly represented by a specific part of a box plot. The arrow labelled 1 points to the highest value within the data set.<br/><br/><b>Q1</b> is incorrect. The first quartile (Q1) is the lower bound of the box and represents the 25th percentile of the data. The arrow labelled 1 points to the highest value, not Q1.<br/><br/><b>Outlier</b> is incorrect. Outliers are represented by individual points outside the whiskers of the box plot. The arrow labelled 1 points to the highest value within the whisker range, not to an outlier.<br/><br/><b>Q3</b> is incorrect. The third quartile (Q3) is the upper bound of the box and represents the 75th percentile of the data. The arrow labelled 1 points to the highest value, which is above Q3.<br/><br/><b>Median</b> is incorrect. The median (Q2) is represented by the line inside the box, dividing it into two parts. The arrow labelled 1 points to the highest value, not the median.<br/><br/><b>Mean</b> is incorrect. The mean is not typically represented by a specific part of the box plot unless indicated by a specific marker such as a dot or star. The arrow labelled 1 points to the highest value within the whisker range.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>274.</b></td><td>The arrow labelled 2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Median</b> The correct answer is <b>Median</b>. The arrow labelled 2 points to the line inside the box, which represents the median (Q2) of the dataset.

The highest value is represented by the top whisker of the box plot, not the line inside the box where arrow 2 is pointing.<br/><br/><b>Interquartile range</b> is incorrect.

The arrow labelled 3 points to the bottom of the box, which represents the first quartile (Q1). The first quartile marks the 25th percentile of the data, meaning that 25% of the data points are below this value.<br/><br/>Explanation of Other Options:<br/><br/><b>Highest value</b> is incorrect.
