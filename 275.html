<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following values for NNT suggests the most favourable outcome for an intervention?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">NNT = 1</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>NNT = 1</b>. The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is a measure used in assessing the effectiveness of a healthcare intervention, typically a treatment with medication. It represents the average number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one additional bad outcome or produce one additional good outcome. An NNT of 1 means that every patient treated experiences the beneficial outcome, suggesting a very effective intervention.<br/><br/><b>NNT = 5</b> indicates that on average, one out of every five patients will experience the beneficial outcome due to the intervention. While this still suggests an effective treatment, it's less so than an NNT of 1.<br/><br/>Similarly, <b>NNT = 7</b> means that for every seven patients treated, one will benefit from the intervention. This implies a lower effectiveness than an NNT of 5 or 1.<br/><br/><b>NNT = 23</b> and <b>NNT = 34</b> suggest even lesser effectiveness. For these values, you would need to treat 23 and 34 patients respectively for one patient to experience the beneficial outcome. These higher values indicate that the treatment is less efficient at producing positive outcomes; it may still be worthwhile if there are few alternative treatments or if the potential benefit is significant (such as preventing death), but ideally we would prefer interventions with lower NNT values.<br/><br/>In summary, when interpreting NNT values, lower numbers represent more favourable outcomes because they indicate that fewer people need to be treated in order for one person to benefit from the intervention.<br/><br/></div>
