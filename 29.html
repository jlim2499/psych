<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which one of the following statements regarding odds and odds ratio is correct?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">The odds ratio approximates to relative risk if the outcome of interest is rare</span></div><br/>The correct answer to this question is: <b>The odds ratio approximates to relative risk if the outcome of interest is rare</b>. This statement is true because in situations where the outcome of interest is rare, the odds ratio and relative risk become very similar numerically. An odds ratio (OR) compares the odds of an event occurring in one group to the odds of it occurring in another group. Relative risk (RR), on the other hand, compares the probability of an event occurring in one group with that in another. When an event is rare, both OR and RR provide a similar estimate.<br/><br/>Now let's discuss why each of the other options are incorrect:<br/><br/><b>Odds ratio = 1 / attributable risk</b>: This statement is incorrect. Attributable risk or risk difference measures how much of the disease incidence can be attributed to exposure. It does not have a direct relationship with odds ratio.<br/><br/><b>Is always between 0 and 1 (when expressed as a decimal)</b>: This statement is also incorrect. The value of an odds ratio can range from zero to infinity depending on whether exposure increases or decreases the chance of an outcome. If OR=1, there's no effect from exposure; if OR&lt;1, exposure reduces chances; if OR&gt;1, exposure increases chances.<br/><br/><b>Odds ratios are the most commonly reported measure in cohort studies</b>: This statement isn't accurate either. While odds ratios are frequently used in case-control studies due to their ability to estimate relative risk when data for calculating incidence isn't available, they aren't typically reported as primary measures in cohort studies. In cohort studies, researchers often directly calculate relative risks or hazard ratios.<br/><br/><b>When applied to survival analysis is termed the hazard ratio</b>: This statement is not correct. Although both hazard ratios and odds ratios compare risks between groups, they're not equivalent concepts nor interchangeable terms. A hazard ratio is a measure over time, reflecting the chance of an event happening at a particular moment, while an odds ratio reflects overall odds without considering time.<br/></div>
