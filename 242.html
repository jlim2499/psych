Age in years is an example of ratio data. In the field of statistics, ratio data is defined as a type of numerical data that not only classifies and orders the measurements, but also has meaningful zero point and equal intervals. With ratio data, you can perform all mathematical operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and so forth. This makes sense when thinking about age - it's possible to say someone is twice as old as someone else (multiplication), or that they are five years younger (subtraction).<br/><br/>The first incorrect option was <b>nominal</b>. Nominal data refers to named categories without any order or priority. Examples include gender (male, female), blood group (A, B, AB, O) or ethnicity. Clearly age does not fall into this category because it has a clear order and can be subjected to mathematical operations.<br/><br/>The second incorrect option was <b>ordinal</b>. Ordinal data refers to categories that have a natural order or ranking but without consistent differences between them. An example might be stages of cancer (Stage I, II, III and IV). While ages can be ranked from youngest to oldest much like ordinal data categories could be ranked in their order of severity or importance; the key difference lies in the fact that there are consistent differences between each year of age which is not true for ordinal categories.<br/><br/>The third incorrect option was <b>dichotomous</b>. Dichotomous data is a type of nominal variable with only two categories or levels. Examples include yes/no questions such as 'Are you currently pregnant?' Again this does not apply to age which has many possible values rather than just two.<br/><br/>Finally we have the last incorrect option: <b>interval</b>. Interval data is numerical information where differences are meaningful due to equal intervals between values; however there's no true zero point. Temperature is a good example, as the difference between 10 and 20 degrees is the same as between 20 and 30 degrees, but there's no true zero point (0 degrees does not mean 'no temperature'). Age in years does have a true zero point - when someone is born, their age is zero. Therefore, it doesn't fit this category either.<br/></div>
