Few studies have investigated the associations between specific media content and suicide rates. Even less is known about the possible preventive effects of suicide-related media content. <br/><br/>Aims: <br/><br/>To test the hypotheses that certain media content is associated with an increase in suicide, suggesting a so-called Werther effect, and that other content is associated with a decrease in suicide, conceptualised as a Papageno effect. Further, to identify classes of media articles with similar reporting profiles and to test for associations between these classes and suicide. <br/><br/>Method:  <br/><br/>Content analysis and latent class analysis (LCA) of 497 suicide-related print media reports published in Austria between 1 January and 30 June 2005. Ecological study to identify associations between media item content and short-term changes in suicide rates. <br/><br/>Results: <br/><br/>Repetitive reporting of the same suicide and the reporting of suicide myths were positively associated with suicide rates. Coverage of individual suicidal ideation not accompanied by suicidal behaviour was negatively associated with suicide rates. The LCA yielded four classes of media reports, of which the mastery of crisis class (articles on individuals who adopted coping strategies other than suicidal behaviour in adverse circumstances) was negatively associated with suicide, whereas the expert opinion class and the epidemiological facts class were positively associated with suicide. <br/><br/><b>QUESTION</b> <br/><br/>The following figure is a box plot of the weekly suicide rates (deaths/ 100,000 of the population) and article counts for each of the ten most frequent key markets of the Australian newspapers in the observation period of the study. <br/><br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><a class="fancybox" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb030b.png" rel="group"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb030.png"/></a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"><a class="fancybox lbmagglasslink" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb030b.png" rel="group"><img src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/>In view of the above information answer the questions that follow?<br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>295.</b></td><td>Which key market had the highest median value of suicides? </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>7</b> The correct answer is <b>Key market 7</b>. The box plot for key market 7 shows the highest median value of suicides among the ten most frequent key markets. This indicates that key market 7 consistently had a higher central tendency in suicide rates during the observation period.<br/><br/>How to Identify the Median Value:<br/><br/>Locate the Box: In a box plot, the data is summarised using a box that shows the interquartile range (IQR) and whiskers that extend to the minimum and maximum values excluding outliers.<br/><br/>Find the Line Inside the Box: The line inside the box represents the median (Q2) of the dataset. It divides the box into two parts.<br/><br/>Interpret the Median: The median is the value that separates the higher half from the lower half of the data. For key market 7, the median value of suicide rates is the line within the box.<br/><br/>Understanding What the Star Represents:<br/><br/>Locate the Star: In the box plot provided, the star is an additional marker placed within the box.<br/><br/>Interpret the Star: The star typically represents the mean (average) value of the data. While the median divides the data into two equal parts, the mean is the average of all the data points.<br/><br/>Mean vs Median: The mean can be influenced by outliers and extreme values, whereas the median provides a measure of the central value that is less affected by skewed data.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>296.</b></td><td>Which key market had the most skewed data? </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>1</b> The correct answer is <b>Key market 1</b>. The box plot for key market 1 shows a significant skewness, with a long tail extending towards higher values, indicating a right (positive) skew. This skewness suggests that while most of the data points are clustered towards the lower end, there are a few higher values pulling the distribution to the right.<br/><br/>Identifying Skewed Data:<br/><br/>Locate the Whiskers: In a box plot, whiskers extend from the quartiles to the minimum and maximum values, excluding outliers.<br/><br/>Observe the Median Line: If the median line is closer to one end of the box, it indicates skewness.<br/><br/>Check for Long Tails: A longer whisker on one side signifies skewness in that direction. In key market 1, the longer upper whisker indicates positive skewness.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>297.</b></td><td>Which key market had the largest interquartile range? </td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>9</b> The correct answer is <b>Key market 9</b>. The box plot for key market 9 shows the largest interquartile range (IQR), which is the distance between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). The IQR represents the middle 50% of the data and provides a measure of statistical dispersion.<br/><br/>Identifying the Largest Interquartile Range:<br/><br/>Locate the Box: In a box plot, the box itself represents the interquartile range (IQR).<br/>Measure the Length of the Box: The length of the box, from Q1 to Q3, indicates the IQR. The larger the box, the larger the IQR.<br/><br/>Compare Across Markets: By comparing the length of the boxes across different key markets, the box plot for key market 9 has the longest box, indicating the largest IQR.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/></div>
