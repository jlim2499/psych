<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A study is conducted to estimate the rate at which people with schizophrenia die by suicide. A group of 1000 patients with schizophrenia are followed up over a 20 year period. At the end of the study period the researcher notes that there have been a number of competing events. <br/>Which of the following would be the best summary measure to use in this case?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Incidence rate</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Incidence rate</b>. Incidence rate is a measure of the frequency with which an event, such as illness or death, occurs in a population over a specific period of time. In this case, where there are competing events (other causes of death besides suicide), incidence rate would be the best summary measure to use. It calculates the number of new cases per person-time at risk, accounting for people who might have been lost to follow-up during the study period or experienced competing events. It provides a dynamic measure that accounts for changes in risk over time.<br/><br/><b>Incidence proportion</b>, also known as cumulative incidence, measures the probability that a healthy individual will develop a certain disease during a specified period of time. However, it assumes no loss to follow-up or competing risks which makes it unsuitable for this scenario.<br/><br/><b>Period prevalence</b> refers to all cases of a disease (new and pre-existing) that exist in a population over a specific time period. This would not be suitable here because we are interested in new cases (suicides) occurring over the 20-year study period among patients already diagnosed with schizophrenia.<br/><br/><b>Cumulative incidence</b>, similar to incidence proportion, considers the entire at-risk population as denominator but assumes that all subjects are followed up for the whole time period or until they experience an event. This does not account for competing risks and hence is not suitable in this context.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Point prevalence</b> refers to the number of individuals who have a specific condition at one particular point in time. It wouldn't be appropriate here as we're measuring new incidents (suicides) over an extended period and not just assessing how many people had committed suicide at one specific point.<br/><br/></div>
