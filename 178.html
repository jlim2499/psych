<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is true of correlation and regression?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Regression allows one variable to be predicted from another variable</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Regression allows one variable to be predicted from another variable</b>. Regression is a statistical method that helps in understanding the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is particularly useful in making predictions. For example, in clinical practice, regression can be utilised to predict a patient's blood pressure based on their age, weight, and lifestyle factors.<br/><br/><b>If no correlation is found, regression is often still useful</b>. This statement is incorrect. Correlation and regression are related concepts; a lack of correlation between variables suggests that there is no linear relationship to model through regression. If there is no correlation, regression analysis would not provide a meaningful predictive model. Clinically, this means that if two clinical measurements do not correlate, using one to predict the other would be unreliable.<br/><br/><b>Correlation is concerned with demonstrating difference between variables</b>. This is not accurate. Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables, but it does not concern itself with differences between variables. It only indicates how closely related the variables are. Clinically, understanding correlation helps in identifying associations but does not imply causation or difference.<br/><br/><b>Spearman's correlation coefficient is represented by an Œ± value</b>. This statement is incorrect. Spearman's correlation coefficient is represented by the symbol œÅ (rho) or sometimes ùëüùë†, not Œ±. The Œ± value typically refers to the significance level in hypothesis testing. In clinical research, using the correct symbols is crucial for proper interpretation and communication of statistical results.<br/><br/><b>A t-test is a common test of correlation</b>. This is incorrect. A t-test is used to compare the means of two groups and determine if they are statistically different from each other. It does not measure correlation. To test for correlation, Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients are used. In clinical practice, t-tests are used to compare outcomes between treatment and control groups, not to assess relationships between variables.<br/></div>
