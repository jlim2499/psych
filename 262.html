In such plots, the median is represented by the line within the box, which divides the data set into two equal halves. This line is typically located between the first and third quartiles and indicates the middle value of the data when it is ordered numerically.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Confidence interval is not represented in a box and whisker plot. Confidence intervals are used in inferential statistics to indicate the reliability of an estimate.<br/><br/>Mean is usually not shown in a traditional box and whisker plot. While some variations of box plots can include a symbol for the mean, it is not a standard feature.<br/><br/>Standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A box and whisker plot does not specifically show standard deviation; instead, it shows the median and interquartile range.<br/><br/>Mode represents the most frequently occurring value in a data set. It is not depicted in a box and whisker plot as this type of plot focuses on medians and quartiles.<br/><br/>Box and whisker plots are typically used to display the distribution of a dataset based on a five-number summary: minimum, first quartile (Q1), median (Q2), third quartile (Q3), and maximum.<br/></div>
