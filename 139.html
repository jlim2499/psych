The interquartile range (IQR) is a measure of statistical dispersion, being equal to the difference between the upper and lower quartiles. By definition, quartiles divide a rank-ordered data set into four equal parts. The values that separate these parts are called the first, second, and third quartiles; and they are denoted by Q1, Q2, and Q3 respectively. The interquartile range then includes all values from Q1 to Q3. Hence, 25% of the data lies below Q1 (the lower quartile), 50% of the data falls within the IQR (between Q1 and Q3), and 25% of data lies above Q3 (the upper quartile). Therefore, it can be concluded that 50% of a dataset have a value between the lower and upper quartile.<br/><br/>The option <b>100%</b> is incorrect because it suggests that all values in a dataset fall within the interquartile range which is not true as per definition. Only half of the values lie within this range.<br/><br/>Similarly, <b>0%</b> is also incorrect as this would mean none of the data points fall within the IQR which contradicts its actual definition.<br/><br/>The option <b>25%</b> could be misconstrued as correct if one mistakenly considers just one part divided by quartiles i.e., either lower or upper 25%. However, since we're considering both lower and upper quartiles here which include two parts out of four equal parts divided by quartiles hence this option is also incorrect.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>75%</b> might seem correct if you consider everything from below Q1 till above Q3 but remember that's not what was asked. We were asked for proportion between lower and upper quartile i.e., between Q1 and Q3 hence this option is incorrect too.<br/></div>
