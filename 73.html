<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is most affected by the prevalence of a condition?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Positive predictive value</span></div><br/>Precision, sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity are not affected by the prevalence of the condition (they are stable characteristics).<br/><br/>The positive predictive value is low in conditions whereby the prevalence is low.. This is due to the fact that as the prevalence falls, the number of true positives falls also. <br/><br/>Given that<br/><br/>PPV = TP/(TP+FP)<br/><br/>One can see how low numbers of true positives decreases the size of the numerator thus lowering the PPV.<br/></div>
