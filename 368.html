<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>An endocrinologist performs a study to assess whether a patient's HbA1c level is correlated to their LDL level. Assuming both HbA1c and LDL are normally distributed, which one of the following statistical tests is it most appropriate to perform?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Pearson's </span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Correlation<br/><br/><ul><li>Parametric (normally distributed): Pearson's coefficient</li><li>Non-parametric: Spearman's coefficient</li></ul></div>The correct answer is <b>Pearson's</b>. Pearson’s correlation coefficient is the most appropriate statistical test when assessing the relationship between two continuous variables (in this case, HbA1c and LDL levels) that are normally distributed. It measures the strength and direction of the linear association between the two variables, providing a coefficient value between -1 and 1. A real-world example is evaluating the correlation between blood pressure and cholesterol levels in patients.<br/><br/><b>Chi-squared test</b> is incorrect because it is used to assess the association between two categorical variables, not continuous variables like HbA1c and LDL. For example, it could be used to assess whether there is an association between smoking status (categorical) and diabetes prevalence (categorical).<br/><br/><b>Mann-Whitney test</b> is incorrect because it is a non-parametric test used to compare differences between two independent groups when the dependent variable is not normally distributed. In this scenario, the data is normally distributed, and we are evaluating a relationship, not differences between groups.<br/><br/><b>Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient</b> is incorrect because it is a non-parametric alternative to Pearson’s correlation. It is used when at least one of the variables is not normally distributed or when the relationship is monotonic but not linear.<br/><br/><b>McNemar’s test</b> is incorrect because it is designed to assess paired categorical data, such as pre- and post-treatment outcomes in the same individuals. It is not applicable for continuous variables like HbA1c and LDL levels.<br/></div>
