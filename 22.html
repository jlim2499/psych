Participants' genders and their pass/fail outcomes are recorded. Which statistical test is most appropriate to determine if there is a significant association between gender and exam outcome?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Chi-squared test</b> The correct answer is <b>Chi-squared test</b>. The chi-squared test is used to evaluate whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables, in this case, gender (male or female) and clinical exam outcome (pass or fail). Below are the 5 steps leading to this conclusion:<br/><br/>1) Define the research question: The question asks if there is an association between gender and clinical exam outcomes. This indicates a relationship (association) is being tested.<br/>2) Establish the number of groups and whether they are dependent or independent: The two groups (male and female) are independent, as they do not overlap or depend on each other.<br/>3) Identify the variables and their data types: Gender and exam outcome are both categorical variables.<br/>4) Establish if a parametric or non-parametric test is required: Since the data are categorical, parametric tests do not apply. Non-parametric tests, such as the chi-squared test, are used for categorical data.<br/>5) Select the correct statistical test: Based on the above, the chi-squared test is the most appropriate to determine whether there is a statistically significant association between gender and exam outcome.<br/><br/><b>Paired t-test</b>: The paired t-test is used for comparing means within the same group, typically before and after an intervention. Since this study involves independent groups and categorical data, the paired t-test is not appropriate.<br/><br/><b>Mann-Whitney test</b>: The Mann-Whitney test compares the distribution of a continuous or ordinal variable between two independent groups. As this study involves categorical variables (gender and exam outcome), this test is not applicable.<br/><br/><b>Pearson's product-moment coefficient</b>: This test measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables. Gender and exam outcome are categorical, making Pearson's correlation irrelevant in this context.<br/><br/><b>Unpaired t-test</b>: The unpaired t-test compares the means of a continuous variable between two independent groups. Since the variables in this study are categorical, this test is not suitable.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>27.</b></td><td>A study is conducted to evaluate the effect of a new medication on blood pressure in a group of participants. Blood pressure readings are taken before and after the medication is started. The data is found to be non-parametric. Which statistical test would be most appropriate to assess whether there is a significant difference in blood pressure before and after the medication?<br/></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Wilcoxon signed-rank test</b> The correct answer is <b>Wilcoxon signed-rank test</b>. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is used to compare paired data when the data is non-parametric, such as repeated measures (before and after) in the same participants. This test determines whether there is a significant difference in the median values of the two related samples.<br/><br/>Five-Step Framework:<br/><br/>1) Define the research question: The study aims to determine whether there is a significant difference in blood pressure readings before and after starting a new medication, indicating a focus on differences.<br/>2) Establish the number of groups and whether they are dependent or independent:<br/>There is one group of participants, and the blood pressure readings are repeated measures (dependent), taken from the same individuals before and after the medication.<br/>3) Identify the variables and their data types: The dependent variable is blood pressure, which is continuous. However, the data is explicitly described as non-parametric, meaning it does not meet the assumptions of normal distribution.<br/>4) Establish if parametric or non-parametric tests should be used: Since the data is non-parametric, a non-parametric test is required. The paired nature of the data further narrows down the options to tests suitable for related samples.<br/>5) Select the correct statistical test: Given that the data is paired and non-parametric, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is the most appropriate test to determine if there is a significant difference in blood pressure before and after the medication.<br/><br/>Explanation of Other Options:<br/><br/><b>Paired t-test</b>: This test is used for comparing means of two related samples when the data is parametric (normally distributed). However, the question specifies that the data is non-parametric, making this test unsuitable.<br/><br/><b>Mann-Whitney U test</b>: The <b>Mann-Whitney U test</b> is used to compare two independent groups when the data is non-parametric. In this study, the data is paired (not independent), so this test is inappropriate.<br/><br/><b>Chi-squared test</b>: The <b>chi-squared test</b> is used for analysing categorical data to assess associations between variables. Blood pressure is a continuous variable, making this test irrelevant.<br/><br/><b>Unpaired t-test</b>: This test compares the means of two independent groups with parametric data. Since the data in this study is paired and non-parametric, the unpaired t-test is not suitable.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>28.</b></td><td>A study seeks to determine whether there is a correlation between a patient's weight (in kilograms) and their dosage of prescribed antidepressant medication (in milligrams). Weight is a continuous variable that is normally distributed. Dosage is also a continuous variable but does not meet the assumptions of normal distribution (non-parametric). Which statistical test is most appropriate to evaluate this relationship?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Spearman's rank correlation coefficient</b> The correct answer is <b>Spearman's rank correlation coefficient</b>. This test is appropriate because one of the variables (dosage) is non-parametric. Spearman's rank correlation does not require both variables to be normally distributed and evaluates the strength and direction of a monotonic relationship between two continuous variables.<br/><br/>Explanation with 5 Steps:<br/><br/>1) Define the research question: The study seeks to evaluate whether there is a correlation between a patient's weight (normally distributed) and dosage of prescribed antidepressant medication (non-parametric).<br/>2) Establish how many groups there are and if they are dependent or independent: There are no groups; the analysis involves two continuous variables that are inherently dependent within the same individuals.<br/>3) Identify the variables and data types: Weight: Continuous and normally distributed.<br/>Dosage: Continuous and non-parametric.<br/>4) Establish if parametric or non-parametric tests should be used: As dosage does not meet the assumptions of normality, a non-parametric test is required.<br/>5) Select the correct statistical test: Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is the most appropriate test for these variables, as it handles non-parametric data and measures the correlation between them.<br/><br/>Explanation of Other Options:<br/><br/><b>Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient</b>: While this test is often used for correlation, it assumes both variables are continuous and normally distributed. As dosage is not normally distributed, this test is inappropriate here.<br/><br/><b>Chi-squared test</b>: This test evaluates associations between categorical variables. It is unsuitable here as both variables are continuous.<br/><br/><b>Mann-Whitney U test</b>: This is a non-parametric test used to compare medians between two independent groups. As the study does not involve groups, this test is irrelevant.<br/><br/><b>Wilcoxon's rank-sum test</b>: This test is used to compare paired data or matched samples for non-parametric variables. It is not suitable for assessing correlation between two continuous variables.<br/><br/><b>Independent t-test</b>: This test is used to compare the means of two independent groups with normally distributed data. The study involves correlation, not group comparisons, making this test inappropriate.<br/><br/><b>Paired t-test</b>: This test compares means of paired or matched data from the same sample. Since the research question involves correlation, not paired data, it is not suitable.<br/><br/><b>Kendall tau rank correlation coefficient</b>: This test is also a non-parametric measure of correlation and is an alternative to Spearman's. However, it is more appropriate for smaller datasets or data with many tied ranks. Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation is generally preferred for larger datasets.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/></div>
