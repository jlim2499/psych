A Forest plot, also known as a blobbogram, is a graphical display designed to illustrate the relative strength of treatment effects in multiple quantitative scientific studies. It was developed for use in medical research as a means of representing a meta-analysis of the results of randomised controlled trials. In this graph, each square represents an individual study - its size is proportional to the weight of the study in the meta-analysis. The horizontal lines through each square represent the confidence intervals, and the diamond at the bottom represents the pooled result.<br/><br/>The first incorrect option is <b>Scatter plot</b>. A scatter plot uses Cartesian coordinates to display values for two variables from a set of data. The points are plotted on a graph to represent two types of quantities. This type of graph does not match with our image because it doesn't show any squares representing individual studies or diamonds showing pooled results.<br/><br/>The second incorrect option is <b>Box-whisker plot</b>. Box-whisker plots (or box plots) are used to show groups of numerical data through their quartiles. They may also have lines (whiskers) extending from the boxes indicating variability outside the upper and lower quartiles. However, they do not have squares representing individual studies or diamonds showing pooled results which makes them different from Forest plots.<br/><br/>The third incorrect option is <b>Funnel plot</b>. Funnel plots are primarily used in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. They serve as visual aids to detect bias or systematic heterogeneity. A funnel plot is so named because it should resemble an inverted funnel if there's no publication bias present in your analysed studies - wider at the top (indicating higher variance among smaller studies), narrowing down towards one point (indicating low variance among larger studies). <br/><br/>Finally, <b>Stem-leaf plot</b> is also incorrect. A stem-and-leaf display or plot is a device for presenting quantitative data in a graphical format, similar to a histogram, which can assist in visualising the shape of a set of data. This type of graph is different from Forest plots because it doesn't represent individual studies as squares and pooled results as diamonds.<br/></div>
