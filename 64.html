This statistical test is used to assess the null hypothesis that data are drawn from a normally distributed population. It is an adaptation of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and is more sensitive when it comes to detecting departures from normality. In other words, Lilliefors' test checks if the data follow a normal distribution, which is one of the assumptions for using parametric tests.<br/><br/>The <b>Wilcoxon rank test</b>, also known as Wilcoxon signed-rank test, does not check for normality. Instead, it's a non-parametric statistical hypothesis test used when comparing two related samples or repeated measurements on a single sample to assess whether their population mean ranks differ. It can be used as an alternative to the paired Student's t-test when the population cannot be assumed to be normally distributed.<br/><br/>Similarly, the <b>Logrank test</b> does not check for normality but it is used in survival analysis. The Logrank Test compares the survival times of two or more groups and it's particularly suitable when dealing with censored data (data where we know only partial information).<br/><br/><b>Kendall’s rank correlation coefficient</b>, often referred to as Kendall’s tau coefficient, measures ordinal association — that is, the strength of dependence between two variables. However, like other options given here apart from Lilliefor's Test, it doesn't verify if a dataset follows a normal distribution or not.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>Somer's rank test</b> (or Somers' D) also doesn't check for normality but instead measures the strength and direction of association between two random variables. <br/><br/>In conclusion, while all these tests are useful in different statistical contexts and applications, only Lilliefor's test would help confirm if it was appropriate to use a parametric test on a given data set by checking for normal distribution.<br/></div>
