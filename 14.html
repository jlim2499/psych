A type II error, also known as a beta error, occurs in statistical hypothesis testing when the null hypothesis (H0) is not rejected when it should be. This implies that a false negative result has been found, suggesting there is no effect or relationship when in fact one exists. <br/><br/>Discussing the incorrect options:<br/><br/><b>The test is biased</b> - Bias in a test refers to systematic errors that can skew results, and it does not specifically relate to Type II errors. Bias can affect any part of a study design or methodology and may lead to either Type I or Type II errors depending on the nature of the bias.<br/><br/><b>The p-value is greater than 0.05</b> - A p-value greater than 0.05 typically indicates that the observed data are consistent with the null hypothesis at the chosen significance level (usually 5%). This does not necessarily mean a Type II error has occurred as it doesn't automatically imply that the null hypothesis was falsely accepted; instead, there might not have been strong enough evidence against it.<br/><br/><b>The sample mean differs from the population mean</b> - This situation doesnâ€™t directly link to a Type II error. Instead, this could suggest sampling error or potential bias in sample selection but doesn't inherently signify an incorrect acceptance or rejection of a null hypothesis.<br/><br/><b>The null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected when it is true</b> - This scenario describes a Type I error (or alpha error), not a Type II error. A Type I error occurs when we reject the null hypothesis even though it's true, leading to a false-positive result.<br/></div>
