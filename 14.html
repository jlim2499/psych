<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is true regarding the LUNSERS?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">It includes 'red herring' items</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>It includes 'red herring' items</b>. The Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effect Rating Scale (LUNSERS) includes 'red herring' items, which are symptoms not typically associated with neuroleptic side effects. The LUNSERS (Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effect Rating Scale) is a 51-item self-administered rating scale used to identify side effects from neuroleptic medication (antipsychotics).<br/><br/>It includes 41 known side effects of neuroleptics, and ten red herring items, including hair loss and chilblains, which are not known side effects of neuroleptic medication. In addition, 10 'red herring' items were included, referring to symptoms that are not known neuroleptic side-effects (e.g., chilblains, hair loss), to help validate the results.<br/><br/><b>It is used to screen for cognitive impairments</b> is incorrect. The LUNSERS is not used to screen for cognitive impairments; it is designed to identify the side effects of neuroleptic (antipsychotic) medications.<br/><br/><b>It needs to be rated by a clinician</b> is incorrect. The LUNSERS is a self-reported scale, meaning that patients themselves complete it based on their own experiences of side effects from medication.<br/><br/><b>It is used to identify side effects of antidepressant drugs</b> is incorrect. The LUNSERS is specifically designed to identify side effects of neuroleptic (antipsychotic) medications, not antidepressants.<br/><br/><b>It is not validated for female populations</b> is incorrect. The LUNSERS has been validated for use in diverse populations, including females, to assess the side effects of neuroleptic medications.<br/><br/>Validity and reliability have been tested in a group of 50 male and female patients with a mean age of 46 years and 16 years of antipsychotic use, along with a group of 50 healthy controls, with promising results. The validity of the LUNSERS has also been tested against the UKU (the gold standard which takes about 60 minutes to do).<br/></div>
