<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Regarding the interquartile range, what proportion of a data set have a value below the second quartile?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">50%</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>50%</b>. The interquartile range is a statistical measure that represents the middle 50% of a data set. It is calculated by subtracting the first quartile (25th percentile) from the third quartile (75th percentile). Therefore, by definition, 50% of values lie below the second quartile (which is also known as the median), and 50% of values lie above it.<br/><br/>The option <b>25%</b> incorrectly suggests that only a quarter of the data lies below the second quartile. This would be true for the first quartile, not the second. <br/><br/>The option <b>75%</b> overstates the proportion of data lying below the second quartile. While it's true that 75% of data lies below the third quartile, this does not apply to the second quartile or median.<br/><br/>Similarly, both options <b>10%</b> and <b>60%</b> are incorrect as they do not align with any specific percentiles in relation to quartiles within a dataset. The only fixed percentage points within a dataset are at each of its quartiles: 25%, 50%, and 75%.<br/></div>
