A case series is a type of primary evidence because it consists of original research where clinical data are collected directly from patients experiencing a specific condition, in this case, chronic leukocytosis associated with clozapine. Primary evidence includes empirical research such as randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, and case series, as these provide first-hand data and are crucial for understanding real-world effects and outcomes in clinical practice. A case series can inform psychiatrists of potential adverse effects of clozapine, helping them monitor and manage patients on this medication effectively.<br/><br/><b>NICE guidelines on anxiety in adolescents</b> are considered secondary evidence. Guidelines are based on a review of primary research and provide recommendations for clinical practice. While valuable for day-to-day decision-making, they are not primary research because they summarise and interpret existing evidence rather than generate new data.<br/><br/><b>A meta-analysis of sleep and psychiatric disorders</b> is also secondary evidence. Meta-analyses involve synthesising data from multiple primary studies to provide an overarching conclusion. Although meta-analyses offer high-quality evidence due to their comprehensive nature, they do not represent original research but rather an analysis of previously published data.<br/><br/><b>A systematic review of patient outcomes following discharge from secure psychiatric hospitals</b> is another form of secondary evidence. Systematic reviews collect and appraise primary research studies to summarise findings. They do not involve the generation of new, original data but instead interpret a body of existing evidence.<br/><br/><b>The Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry</b> is a textbook, which is a secondary or tertiary source. Textbooks summarise and interpret existing research and knowledge. They are helpful for providing overviews of psychiatric conditions but do not provide new data or original research. Therefore, it is not primary evidence.<br/></div>
