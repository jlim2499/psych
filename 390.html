<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is a major limitation of ecological studies, such as examining the relationship between lithium levels in water and regional depression rates?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Incorrect inference from group-level data to individuals</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Ecological fallacy â†’ error of assuming that relationships observed at the group level apply to individuals within the group</div>The correct answer is <b>Incorrect inference from group-level data to individuals</b>. This limitation, often referred to as the ecological fallacy, arises when conclusions about individuals are drawn from group-level data. For example, assuming that individuals living in regions with high lithium levels in water are less likely to suffer from depression based on population-level correlations is misleading, as the relationship may not hold true at the individual level.<br/><br/><b>High cost and time-consuming data collection</b>: This is incorrect. Ecological studies typically rely on existing datasets (e.g., public health or environmental data), making them relatively inexpensive and less time-consuming compared to studies requiring individual-level data collection.<br/><br/><b>Difficulty in establishing temporal relationships</b>: This is incorrect. While temporal relationships can be challenging to ascertain in cross-sectional ecological studies, this limitation is not unique to ecological studies and applies to many observational study designs.<br/><br/><b>Lack of control over confounding variables</b>: This is incorrect. Although ecological studies may have limited control over confounding variables due to reliance on aggregated data, this is not their primary limitation. The ecological fallacy remains the most significant issue.<br/><br/><b>Limited generalisability due to small sample sizes</b>: This is incorrect. Ecological studies typically involve large datasets aggregated across populations or regions, which generally enhances their generalisability rather than limiting it.<br/></div>
