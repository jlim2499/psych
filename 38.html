<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following cannot be used to address confounding in a study?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Fixed effect model</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Fixed effect model</b>. A fixed effect model, in the context of statistical analysis, is used to measure the impact of variables that vary over time. It does not address confounding, which refers to a situation where an observed effect between an exposure and an outcome is distorted by the presence of another variable.  The fixed effects model applies to heterogeneity (as in meta-analysis).<br/><br/><b>Matching</b>, on the other hand, can be used to control for confounding. This technique involves pairing participants who have similar characteristics apart from the variable under investigation. By doing this, researchers can ensure that any differences observed are likely due to the variable being studied rather than confounders.<br/><br/><b>Restriction</b> also addresses confounding by limiting study participants to those who fall within certain criteria. By restricting participation in this way, researchers can reduce the likelihood that potential confounders will distort their findings.<br/><br/><b>Randomisation</b> is another method used to deal with confounding. This involves randomly assigning participants to different groups so as to balance out any potential confounders across these groups. Randomisation helps ensure that any differences observed are due to the intervention or exposure being studied and not because of other factors.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)</b> can be used to control for confounding by adjusting for potential covariates that may influence the outcome variable. ANCOVA allows researchers to examine whether certain factors have a significant effect on the outcome variable after controlling for one or more covariates.<br/><br/>In summary, all options except 'fixed effect model' are techniques commonly employed in research studies to address issues related to confounding.<br/></div>
