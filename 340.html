<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>In an attempt to calculate a patients average daily intake of food, a nurse records their calorie intake over a seven day period. They then take the sum of the values for the seven days and divide the total by seven. Which of the following have they calculated?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Arithmetic mean</span></div><br/>The correct answer is the <b>Arithmetic mean</b>. The arithmetic mean is calculated by adding up all the values and then dividing by the number of values. In this case, the nurse has added up the calorie intake for seven days and divided it by seven, which is exactly how an arithmetic mean is calculated.<br/><br/>The <b>Harmonic mean</b> is incorrect because it's a type of average that is calculated by dividing the number of observations by the sum of reciprocal of the value. It's used when dealing with rates such as speed or other quantities where there's a time factor involved. This would not be applicable in this case where we are simply looking at calorie intake over a period of time without any rate or time factor involved.<br/><br/>The <b>Weighted mean</b>, also known as weighted average, is incorrect because it takes into account not just the values themselves but also their 'weight' or importance. In this scenario, there's no indication that certain days' calorie intakes are more important or carry more weight than others.<br/><br/>The option <b>Generalised mean</b>, also known as power mean, is incorrect because it involves raising each value to a specified power, adding them together, taking their average and then taking the root of that average. There's no mention in this scenario about raising each day's calorie count to a certain power before averaging them out.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>Geometric mean</b> is incorrect because it involves multiplying all values together and then taking the nth root (where n = number of values). In our case, there was no multiplication involved in calculating daily food intake; thus geometric mean doesn't apply here.<br/></div>
