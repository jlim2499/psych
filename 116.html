Case-control studies are ideally suited for studying conditions where there is a long lag between exposure and outcome because they start with the outcome and look backwards to investigate exposures. This retrospective approach makes it possible to study rare diseases and conditions that take a long time to develop.<br/><br/><b>Cohort Study</b> is incorrect. While cohort studies can be useful for studying long-term outcomes, they involve following a group of people over time from exposure to outcome. This can be time-consuming and expensive, especially for conditions with a long latency period.<br/><br/><b>Randomised Controlled Trial</b> is incorrect. Randomised controlled trials are designed to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. They are not typically suited for conditions with a long lag between exposure and outcome due to the practical and ethical difficulties in maintaining long-term randomised conditions.<br/><br/><b>Analytic Cross-Sectional Study</b> is incorrect. Cross-sectional studies measure exposure and outcome at the same time. They are best for assessing prevalence and cannot establish temporal relationships, making them unsuitable for conditions with a long latency period.<br/><br/><b>Ecological Study</b> is incorrect. Ecological studies focus on populations rather than individuals and are useful for generating hypotheses but not for establishing cause-and-effect relationships in conditions with a long lag between exposure and outcome.<br/></div>
