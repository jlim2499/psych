Early identification of affected children will lead to early intervention and favourable long-term outcome. Screening for developmental delay is not yet routine by many primary healthcare providers due to lack of locally available, rapid and sensitive screening tools in busy Paediatric HIV clinics. A new screening tool was developed at the Red Cross War Memorial Childrens Hospital (RCWMCH) for detecting moderate to severe global developmental delay among very young HIV infected children. The diagnostic accuracy and usefulness of the new tool was evaluated in this study.<br/><br/>Objective: <br/><br/>To validate the new RCWMCH developmental screening tool among HIV-infected South African children. <br/><br/>Method:<br/><br/>Forty-seven HIV-infected children in the age category 9-36 months attending the Infectious Disease Clinic (IDC) of the RCWMCH were screened using the new tool. Full developmental assessments of same children were performed using the Bayley Scale of Infant Development (BSID-III). Developmental Delay (global) was defined as composite scores 2 standard deviations below the mean in two or more developmental domains. <br/><br/>Results:<br/><br/>Out of the 26 children found to be delayed on the RCWMCH screening, 11 were confirmed delayed on the BSID-III. Conversely, 18 children out of the total 21 who were not delayed on the RCWMCH screening were also confirmed not to have any developmental delay on the BSID-III.<br/><br/><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>222.</b></td><td>What is the sensitivity of the RCWMCH screening tool?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>78.57%</b> Sensitivity is calculated by the following:<br/><br/>Sensitivity = TP/(TP+FN)<br/><br/>So..<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid1"><thead><tr><th></th><th>BDS-III Delayed</th><th>BDS-III not delayed</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>RCWMCH Delayed</td><td>11 (TP)</td><td>15(FP)</td></tr><tr><td>RCWMCH Not delayed</td><td>3 (FN)</td><td>18(TN)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>Sensitivity  = 11 / (11 + 3)<br/><br/>Sensitivity = 78.57%</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>223.</b></td><td>What is the specificity of the RCWMCH screening tool?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td> 54.55% Specificity is calculated by the following:<br/><br/>Specificity = TN/(FP+TN)<br/><br/>So..<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid1"><thead><tr><th></th><th>BDS-III Delayed</th><th>BDS-III not delayed</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>RCWMCH Delayed</td><td>11 (TP)</td><td>15(FP)</td></tr><tr><td>RCWMCH Not delayed</td><td>3 (FN)</td><td>18(TN)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>Specificity = 18 / (18 + 15)<br/><br/>Specificity = 54.55%</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>224.</b></td><td>What is the Positive Likelihood Ratio of the RCWMCH screening tool?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>1.73</b> Likelihood ratio for a positive test result (LR+) = probability of a patient with a disease having a positive test divided by the probability of a patient without the disease having a positive test result<br/><br/>LR+ = true positive rate / false positive rate<br/><br/>Or can be put another way<br/><br/>LR+ = sensitivity / (1 - specificity)<br/><br/>So..<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid1"><thead><tr><th></th><th>BDS-III Delayed</th><th>BDS-III not delayed</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>RCWMCH Delayed</td><td>11 (TP)</td><td>15(FP)</td></tr><tr><td>RCWMCH Not delayed</td><td>3 (FN)</td><td>18(TN)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>LR+ = (11/14) / (15/33)<br/><br/>LR+ = 1.73</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/></div>
