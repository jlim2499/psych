This is a type of random sampling method where the researcher divides the population into separate groups, called clusters. A simple random sample of clusters is then selected from the population. The researcher then collects data from every individual in each chosen cluster. This method allows for greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness in large-scale studies.<br/><br/><b>Quota Sampling</b> is not a random sampling method, but rather a non-probability sampling technique. In quota sampling, the researcher ensures that certain characteristics are proportionally represented within the sample. For instance, if 50% of your population is female, you would ensure that 50% of your sample is female. However, individuals are not randomly selected within these quotas which can lead to selection bias.<br/><br/><b>Snowball Sampling</b>, another non-random technique, involves existing study subjects recruiting future subjects from among their acquaintances. Therefore, the samples begin small and increase in size as participants recruit others. This method is often used when members of a population are hard to locate or reach.<br/><br/><b>Voluntary Sampling</b> involves participants self-selecting to be part of a study - they volunteer when asked or respond to an open invitation. Whilst it may be convenient and inexpensive, this approach can also introduce bias as those who choose to participate may differ significantly from those who do not.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Convenience Sampling</b>, as its name suggests, involves choosing individuals who are easiest to reach or most convenient for the researcher to sample. While this approach might be easy and efficient for researchers, it’s highly prone to selection bias because it doesn’t involve any form of random selection.<br/><br/></div>
