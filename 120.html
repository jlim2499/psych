<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following best exemplifies concurrent validity in a psychiatric context?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Using a new depression scale and comparing its results to a validated scale administered simultaneously</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Using a new depression scale and comparing its results to a validated scale administered simultaneously</b>. Concurrent validity evaluates whether a new measure correlates well with an established measure of the same construct administered at the same time. This option directly tests the concept.<br/><br/><b>Testing a depression scale against an anxiety scale to assess differentiation</b>: This tests discriminant validity, not concurrent validity. Discriminant validity assesses whether the scale measures a construct distinct from other unrelated constructs.<br/><br/><b>Administering a new schizophrenia scale and reassessing the same patients in six months</b>: This evaluates test-retest reliability or predictive validity rather than concurrent validity, as it examines consistency or predictive capabilities over time.<br/><br/><b>Using a new personality inventory to predict future job performance</b>: This relates to predictive validity, which assesses whether a measure accurately forecasts a future outcome or behaviour, not concurrent validity.<br/><br/><b>Comparing a new anxiety scale to a scale measuring physical health symptoms</b>: This does not reflect concurrent validity because the comparison is between unrelated constructs. Concurrent validity requires the comparison of measures targeting the same or closely related constructs.<br/></div>
