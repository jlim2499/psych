Concurrent validity requires that a new scale strongly correlates with a well-established measure of the same construct. A poor correlation suggests the new scale may lack validity and fail to measure schizophrenia symptoms accurately.<br/><br/><b>An ADHD scale predicts later academic achievement inconsistently</b>: This option reflects predictive validity, which assesses how well a test predicts future outcomes. It is not related to concurrent validity, which evaluates the correlation between two measures taken at the same time.<br/><br/><b>A bipolar disorder screening tool differentiates poorly between mania and depression</b>: This option pertains to discriminant validity, which measures a tool's ability to differentiate between distinct but related constructs. It does not address concurrent validity.<br/><br/><b>An anxiety measure has high internal consistency but low test-retest reliability</b>: This describes aspects of reliability, not validity. Internal consistency measures how well items on a test correlate, and test-retest reliability evaluates stability over time. Neither directly relates to concurrent validity.<br/><br/><b>A depression inventory has moderate correlations with clinician-reported anxiety severity</b>: This reflects convergent validity or lack thereof. Convergent validity assesses the degree to which two related but distinct constructs (e.g., depression and anxiety) correlate, which differs from concurrent validity requiring high correlation with a measure of the same construct.<br/></div>
