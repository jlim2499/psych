Variance is a statistical term that measures the dispersion or spread of a set of values. It is calculated by taking the average of squared differences from the mean. This provides information about how much individual data points in a distribution deviate from the average value (mean) of that distribution.<br/><br/><b>Standard deviation</b> while related to variance, is not exactly the same. Standard deviation is simply the square root of variance. It provides a measure of uncertainty around an estimate or a rate, and it's often used alongside the mean to provide a full view of data distribution.<br/><br/>The <b>Interquartile range</b>, on the other hand, measures statistical dispersion, or in simpler terms, it shows where most values in a data set lie. It does this by subtracting the lower quartile (25th percentile) from the upper quartile (75th percentile). While it does provide information on variability within a dataset, it does not specifically deal with deviations from the mean.<br/><br/>A <b>Correlation coefficient</b> measures how closely two variables are related to each other. In other words, it describes both how strong and what kind of relationship exists between two variables. But it doesn't give any insight into variations within one individual dataset around its mean.<br/><br/>Lastly, <b>Standard error</b> refers to the standard deviation of sampling distributions or an estimate thereof. It indicates how accurate an estimate of the population parameter is likely to be and gives us some insight into how much our sample means will vary from population means. Again though, this isn't directly concerned with average squared deviations from our original data's mean value.<br/><br/></div>
