<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>The following abstract (Cohen, 2009) provides details of a study which investigated the use of iv ketamine to predict the response to a dextromethorphan (DX) treatment trial for patient with chronic pain. <br/>The study used a scatter graph to illustrate the association of these two variables. Read the following information and then answer the question that follows.<br/><br/>Chronic pain patients who are treated with opioid therapy represent a significant challenge to medical professionals. When pain recurs in the face of a previously effective opioid regimen, treatment options include dose escalation, opioid rotation, drug holidays, and the addition of adjuvants. Some experts advocate the use of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) antagonists to combat tolerance. Recently, the use of an intravenous (i.v.) ketamine infusion to predict the response to a dextromethorphan (DX) treatment trial has been described. In this study, 56 opioid-exposed patients with recurrent pain were treated with a low-dose (0.1 mg/kg) i.v. ketamine test followed by a DX treatment course. Using previously designated cut off values for a positive response to ketamine (67% or more pain relief) and DX (50% or more pain relief), the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for an i.v. ketamine infusion to predict subsequent response to DX treatment were 72%, 68%, 52%, and 85%, respectively. The observed agreement between analgesic responses was 78%, indicating a highly significant correlation (r=0.54, P=0.0001). Subgroup classification revealed no significant differences in the response to either ketamine or DX treatment based on pain classification (i.e., nociceptive, neuropathic, or mixed) or placebo response. In contrast, a weaker correlation between ketamine and DX response was found in subjects requiring high-dose rather than low-dose opioid therapy. A significant correlation also was noted between the development of side effects for the two NMDA-R antagonists. Based on these results, we conclude that an i.v. ketamine test may be a valuable tool in predicting subsequent response to DX treatment in opioid-exposed patients with persistent pain. <br/><br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><a class="fancybox" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb027b.png" rel="group"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb027.png"/></a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"><a class="fancybox lbmagglasslink" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb027b.png" rel="group"><img src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/><i> Cohen (2009) An Intravenous Ketamine Test as a Predictive Response Tool in Opioid-Exposed Patients with Persistent Pain. J Pain Symptom Manage; 37:698-708.</i> <br/><br/><b>QUESTION</b><br/><br/>What is the most appropriate way of describing the association? <br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Moderate positive linear association</span></div><br/>The scatter graph show the trend line (aka line of best fit) as a straight line running through the centre of the data points. The two curved lines represent confidence intervals. The trend line goes up as it moves from left to right indicating a positive association. The strength of the association can be seen to be moderate by the scatter graph and this is confirmed by the information in the abstract which specifies a correlation coefficient of 0.54.<br/><br/>The correct answer is <b>Moderate positive linear association</b>. The scatter plot demonstrates a moderately positive linear relationship between the percentage of pain relief with ketamine and the percentage of pain relief with DX. This is characterised by the upward trend in the data points, indicating that as pain relief with ketamine increases, pain relief with DX also tends to increase.<br/><br/><b>Strong negative linear correlation</b> is incorrect because a strong negative correlation would indicate that as one variable increases, the other decreases. However, the scatter plot shows that both variables tend to increase together, suggesting a positive relationship rather than a negative one.<br/><br/><b>No correlation</b> is incorrect because the data points in the scatter plot show a clear upward trend, indicating that there is a relationship between the two variables. No correlation would imply that there is no discernible pattern or relationship between the variables, which is not the case here.<br/><br/><b>Weak positive linear association</b> is incorrect because the correlation coefficient (r=0.54) and the scatter plot indicate a stronger relationship than weak. A weak positive association would be characterised by a much more scattered and less defined upward trend in the data points.<br/><br/><b>Strong positive linear association</b> is incorrect because while there is a positive relationship, it is not strong enough to be characterised as 'strong'. A strong positive association would typically have a correlation coefficient closer to 1, with data points tightly clustered around the line of best fit. Here, the correlation is moderate (r=0.54), indicating a less tightly clustered pattern.<br/></div>
