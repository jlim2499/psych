<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is true regarding correlation and regression?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">The correlation type is independent of the strength</span></div><br/>The correct answer is: <b>The correlation type is independent of the strength</b>. The type of correlation, such as Pearson's, Spearman's, or Kendall's, is a separate consideration from how strong the correlation is (the correlation coefficient). Each type of correlation measures the association between variables in different ways, suitable for the data's characteristics.<br/><br/><b>A correlation coefficient of 0.2</b> does not imply a strong correlation. In most contexts, a correlation coefficient of 0.2 is considered a weak association between two variables.<br/><br/><b>When constructing a scatter graph</b>, it is conventional to put the independent variable on the horizontal axis (X-axis) and the dependent variable on the vertical axis (Y-axis), not the other way around.<br/><br/><b>The correlation coefficient</b> is not an appropriate summary of association if a scatter plot has a non-linear pattern. The correlation coefficient assumes a linear relationship between variables; for non-linear relationships, other statistical measures are needed to summarise the association.<br/><br/><b>The correlation coefficient is always between +1 and -1</b>, not +10 and -10. The value of +1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship.<br/></div>
