<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is likely to increase the prevalence of a condition?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">A new treatment for an aggressive form of cancer is discovered that reduces mortality</span></div><br/>The new cancer treatment sounds great as less people will die. Unfortunately this will result in an increase in the prevalence of the condition.<br/><br/>Remember that:<br/><br/>Prevalence = incidence x duration of condition<br/><br/>Therefore the prevalence is increased by an increase in the incidence or duration of a condition. It is reduced by reductions in the incidence (decreased detection if diagnostic centres close or successful preventative measures are introduced) or by reductions in the duration of the condition.<br/></div>
