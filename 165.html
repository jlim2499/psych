<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A psychiatrist aims to conduct a qualitative study to explore the experiences of patients referred to the outpatient clinic. To obtain a sample, the psychiatrist asks the receptionist to hand an invitation to participate in the study to all follow-up patients who attend for an appointment. The recruitment phase continues until a total of 30 people agree to be in the study. <br/>How is this sampling method best described?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Opportunistic sampling</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Opportunistic sampling</b>. This is a type of non-probability sampling where the researcher selects participants based on their easy accessibility and proximity. In this scenario, the psychiatrist uses an opportunistic or convenience sampling method by recruiting patients who are readily available (i.e., those attending follow-up appointments at the outpatient clinic). The sample size is determined by reaching a predefined number of participants (30 in this case), which again aligns with the characteristics of opportunistic sampling.<br/><br/><b>Snowball sampling</b> is incorrect because it involves initial participants recruiting further participants among their acquaintances. This method is commonly used when studying hidden populations or sensitive topics, where potential respondents may not be easily accessible or willing to participate. In this scenario, there's no mention of patients referring others to join the study.<br/><br/><b>Random sampling</b> does not apply here as it refers to a probabilistic method where each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. This approach reduces selection bias and increases generalisability but requires a comprehensive list of all members in the targeted population. In this case, not all eligible patients were given an equal opportunity to participate; only those who attended for appointments during the recruitment phase were invited.<br/><br/><b>Chain referral sampling</b>, similar to snowball sampling, relies upon referrals from initial subjects to generate additional subjects. It is often used in studies where members of a specific population are difficult to locate. Again, this does not fit with our scenario as there was no referral process involved for participant recruitment.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Purposive sampling</b> involves selecting individuals who have specific characteristics or experiences that will best inform understanding of the research question. The researcher uses their judgment to choose participants who are considered most representative or informative about the phenomenon under investigation. In our situation, there was no specific criteria set for participant selection beyond attendance at follow-up appointments, hence this is not a purposive sampling method.<br/></div>
