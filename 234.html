<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following refers to the persistent, usual, or expected level of disease in a given population?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Endemic</span></div><br/><i><b>Previous Exam Question</b></i><br/><br/>The correct answer is <b>Endemic</b>. The term 'endemic' refers to the constant presence and/or usual prevalence of a disease or infectious agent in a population within a geographic area. It implies that there is an expected level of the disease in a certain geographical location based on historical trends. For instance, malaria is endemic in some parts of Africa.<br/><br/>The term <b>Prosodemic</b> does not exist in epidemiological or medical terminology, hence it cannot be the right answer.<br/><br/><b>Philodemic</b>, similarly, is not a recognized term in medical or epidemiological literature and so it cannot refer to any level of disease prevalence.<br/><br/>An <b>Epidemic</b> refers to an increase, often sudden, in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in that population in that area. This differs from endemic as it signifies an unexpected increase in disease incidence. An epidemic occurs when an infectious disease spreads rapidly to many people. For example, the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa was an epidemic.<br/><br/>A <b>Pandemic</b> refers to an epidemic that has spread over several countries or continents, usually affecting a large number of people. Pandemics are more about geographical spread rather than just high levels of illnesses. A classic example would be the current COVID-19 pandemic which has affected people globally and not just limited to specific regions unlike endemic diseases.<br/><br/></div>
