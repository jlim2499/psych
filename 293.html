<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Read the following about the study (Gurillo, 2015) on tobacco use and psychosis and then select the true statement from the list of options below.<br/>Background: <br/><br/>Although the association between psychotic illness and cigarette smoking is well known, the reasons are unclear why people with psychosis are more likely to smoke than are the general population. We aimed to test several hypotheses. First, that daily tobacco use is associated with an increased risk of psychotic illness in both case-control and prospective studies. Second, that smoking is associated with an earlier age at onset of psychotic illness. Finally, that an earlier age at initiation of smoking is associated with an increased risk of psychosis. We also aimed to derive an estimate of the prevalence of smoking in patients presenting with their first episode of psychosis. <br/><br/>Methods: <br/><br/>We searched Embase, Medline, an d PsycINFO and selected observational studies in which rates of smoking were reported in people with psychotic disorders, compared with controls. We calculated the weighted mean difference for age at onset of psychosis and age at initiation of smoking. For categorical outcomes, we calculated odds ratios from cross-sectional studies and risk ratios from prospective studies. <br/><br/>We calculated the weighted mean difference for continuous data, which were age at onset of psychosis and age at initiation of smoking. For the categorical outcomes of rates of tobacco use in patients and controls, we calculated odds ratios from cross-sectional data and relative risks from prospective data. We used a random-effects model in all analyses because we expected the data to be heterogeneous across studies. <br/><br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><a class="fancybox" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb026b.png" rel="group"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb026.png"/></a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"><a class="fancybox lbmagglasslink" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb026b.png" rel="group"><img src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/><i>Gurillo (2015) Does tobacco use cause psychosis?

You need to look into the study method to see which statistical model was used (fixed effect model or random effect model). In a fixed effects model the box size is essentially the sample size for that study. In a random effects model this is not the case and the weighting procedure is more complicated. Therefore, whilst the Zhang study MAY have had the largest sample, we cannot known this simply by looking at the forest plot.<br/></div>
