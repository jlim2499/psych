<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A meta-analysis of 5 trials looking at the effect of depot olanzapine versus depot risperidone on psychotic symptoms (measured by the use of PANSS) finds a difference between the two in each trial.  Which of the following trials produced a statistically significant result with a significance level set at 5%?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Trial 2 shows a reduction of 2 on the PANSS (p=0.001)</span></div><br/>The question asks for the statistically significant result which relates to p values not the most clinically meaningful result which would relate to the PANSS score.<br/><br/>Results with p values less than 0.05 are said to be 'statistically significant'. This is based on the convention of an alpha level set at 5%. <br/></div>
