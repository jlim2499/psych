<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A 75-year-old man is asked to complete the Clock Drawing Test. He draws a reasonably accurate circle, places all 12 numbers correctly and evenly spaced around the clock face, but when asked to set the time to 10 past 11, he draws both clock hands the same length and positions them at 3:00.<br/>What score would this patient receive on the 5-point CDT scoring system?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Three</span></div><br/><i><b>Previous Exam Question</b></i><br/><br/>The correct answer is <b>Three</b>. In this case, the patient drew a reasonably accurate circle and placed the numbers correctly and evenly spaced around the clock, earning 1 point for the clock circle and 1 point for the numbers. Additionally, the patient did draw clock hands, which earns 1 point, despite them being of equal length and set to the wrong time. This results in a total score of 3.<br/><br/><b>One</b>: This would be the score if the patient had only drawn the circle correctly. However, in this case, the patient also correctly placed the numbers and drew clock hands, albeit incorrectly.<br/><br/><b>Two</b>: The score of 2 would be given if the patient drew the circle and correctly placed the numbers but failed to draw the clock hands. Here, the patient did draw clock hands, even though they were set incorrectly, earning an additional point.<br/><br/><b>Four</b>: A score of 4 would require the patient to have drawn the circle, correctly placed the numbers, and drawn the clock hands with proper differentiation in length, but with an incorrect time. In this case, the clock hands were not only of equal length, but they were also set to the wrong time, resulting in the lower score of 3.<br/><br/><b>Five</b>: This would be the score if the patient had drawn the clock perfectly, including the correct circle, number placement, and hands set to the correct time of 10 past 11. In this case, the patient drew the hands incorrectly, leading to a deduction in points.<br/></div>
