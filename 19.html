<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A researcher is asked to study levels of alcohol consumption in patients under the care of a community psychiatric team.<br/>The first phase of the study involved generating a random sample of 300 patients (drawn from a registry held by the psychiatric service database). These people received a mailed questionnaire on alcohol consumption.<br/><br/>The second phase of the study involved home visits to those people who did not reply to the mailed questionnaire. <br/><br/>Which type of bias is the second phase of the study intended to address?<br/><br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Participation bias</span></div><br/>The question is identifying which type of bias the second phase of a study on alcohol consumption is intended to address.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Correct Answer:<br/><br/>Participation bias: This is the correct answer. The second phase of the study, involving home visits to non-responders to the mailed questionnaire, is intended to address participation bias. This type of bias occurs when there's a difference between those who participate and those who do not, which can affect the validity of the study's findings. By following up with non-responders, the researchers aim to include a more representative sample of the population and reduce the likelihood that the results will only reflect the alcohol consumption patterns of those who are more likely to return questionnaires.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Berkson's bias: This bias is more relevant to hospital-based studies, where patients admitted to the hospital are not representative of the general population. It is not directly related to the response to mailed questionnaires.<br/><br/>Referral bias: Referral bias occurs when the study population is affected by the referral process, such as patients being referred to specialists. This bias is not related to questionnaire response rates.<br/><br/>Loss to follow-up bias: This type of bias occurs in longitudinal studies when participants drop out before the study is completed. It does not apply to the initial phase of collecting baseline data through questionnaires.<br/><br/>Exclusion bias: Exclusion bias happens when certain groups or individuals are systematically excluded from the study. The home visits in the second phase of the study appear to be an attempt to include more participants rather than exclude them.<br/></div>
