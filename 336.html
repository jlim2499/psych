<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which one of the following statements regarding relative risk is correct?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">It is the usual outcome measure of cohort studies</span></div><br/>The correct answer is: <b>It is the usual outcome measure of cohort studies</b>. Relative risk (RR), also known as risk ratio, is a measure used in epidemiological studies to estimate the association between exposure to a certain factor and the occurrence of a particular outcome. Cohort studies are observational research designs where two or more groups (cohorts) are followed over time to determine the incidence of an outcome. The RR is then calculated by dividing the incidence rate in the exposed group by that in the non-exposed group. This provides information about whether exposure to a certain factor increases or decreases the risk of developing a certain outcome compared to not being exposed.<br/><br/>The statement <b>Relative risk = 1 - absolute risk reduction</b> is incorrect. Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) is calculated by subtracting the event rate in the treatment group from that in the control group. It represents how much lower (or higher) the probability of an event occurring is after receiving a particular treatment compared to not receiving it. ARR and RR are different measures and cannot be directly converted into each other.<br/><br/><b>Risk may be defined as the odds of an outcome happening</b>, this statement is incorrect because although 'risk' and 'odds' are often used interchangeably, they represent different concepts in epidemiology. Risk refers to the probability that an event will occur, while odds refer to the ratio of events happening versus not happening.<br/><br/>The statement <b>Relative risk = 1 / odds ratio</b> is also incorrect. Although both relative risk and odds ratio measure associations between exposure and outcomes, they do so differently and cannot be directly converted into each other.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>If the risk ratio is less than 1 then the rate of an event is increased compared to controls</b>, this statement is incorrect. A RR less than 1 indicates that there's a decreased likelihood for an event to occur in the exposed group compared to the non-exposed group, not an increased rate.<br/></div>
