Each group's cholesterol levels are measured, and the mean levels are compared. The data for cholesterol levels is continuous and normally distributed. Which statistical test is most appropriate to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of the two groups?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Independent t-test</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Independent t-test</b>. The independent t-test is the appropriate statistical test for comparing the means of two independent groups (Group A and Group B) when the dependent variable, cholesterol levels, is continuous and normally distributed. This test examines whether there is a statistically significant difference between the means of these two groups.<br/><br/>5 Steps:<br/><br/>1) Define the research question: The question asks if there is a difference in cholesterol levels between two groups (antipsychotic vs placebo).<br/>2) Establish how many groups there are and whether they are dependent or independent: There are two independent groups (Group A and Group B).<br/>3) Identify the variables and data types: The dependent variable (cholesterol level) is continuous, and the independent variable (treatment group) is categorical with two levels.<br/>4) Establish if the data is parametric or non-parametric: The data is continuous and normally distributed, making parametric tests suitable.<br/>5) Select the correct statistical test: For comparing means between two independent groups, the independent t-test is the correct choice.<br/><br/><b>Cochran Q test</b>: This test is used for repeated measures on categorical data to assess differences across three or more matched groups. It is not appropriate here as the data is continuous, and the groups are independent.<br/><br/><b>Sign test</b>: The sign test is a non-parametric test used for paired data or matched samples, typically to evaluate medians. It is unsuitable for this scenario, as the groups are independent and the data is normally distributed.<br/><br/><b>McNemar's chi-squared test</b>: McNemar's test is used to evaluate paired categorical data, such as before-and-after measurements on the same subjects. It cannot be applied here since the data is continuous and the groups are independent.<br/><br/><b>Mann Whitney U test</b>: The Mann Whitney U test is a non-parametric alternative to the independent t-test, used when the data is not normally distributed. In this case, the data is continuous and normally distributed, so the independent t-test is preferred.<br/></div>
