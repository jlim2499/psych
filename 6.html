Concurrent validity is established by comparing the results of a new psychometric test with those of an existing, well-validated measure that assesses the same construct. If the new test's scores strongly correlate with the established tool, it demonstrates that the new test accurately measures PTSD at the same point in time. This approach directly evaluates whether the new test is valid for its intended purpose.<br/><br/><b>Examining the ability of the test to predict long-term functional outcomes</b>: This approach assesses predictive validity, not concurrent validity. Predictive validity focuses on how well the test can forecast future outcomes, which is distinct from evaluating its accuracy at the same time as another established measure.<br/><br/><b>Testing whether it differentiates PTSD from generalised anxiety disorder</b>: This approach evaluates discriminant validity, which examines whether a test can distinguish between different constructs. While this is an important psychometric property, it does not address concurrent validity.<br/><br/><b>Administering the test multiple times to assess its internal consistency</b>: This approach is related to reliability, specifically test-retest reliability or internal consistency, which measures the consistency of the test results over time or across items. It does not assess whether the test aligns with another validated measure at the same time.<br/><br/><b>Correlating test scores with the duration of trauma exposure</b>: This approach evaluates construct validity, which tests whether the measure aligns with theoretical expectations (e.g., higher PTSD symptoms with prolonged trauma exposure). While important, it does not assess the concurrent validity of the test against an established measure.<br/></div>
