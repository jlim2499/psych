They are typically distinguished from inferential statistics which help to form conclusions beyond the immediate data.  Descriptive statistics help us to simplify data.<br/><br/><b>Measures of central tendency</b><br/><br/>There are three measures of central tendency, the mean, median, and mode.<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid1"><thead><tr><th><b>Measure</b></th><th><b>Description</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Median</td><td>The median is the middle item in a data set that has been arranged in numerical order.  It may be an actual item in the data set or it may be an item that needs to be calculated. It is not affected by outliers<br/><br/>It is calculated by arranging the items in order then selecting the item whereby half the items are above and half are below. For example in the data set below, the item 3 (in bold) is the median value<br/><br/>1, 3, <b>3</b>, 4, 5<br/><br/>In cases where there are an even number of items the median is half way between the middle two items. For example in the data set below, the median is half way between 3 and 4 which is 3.5<br/><br/>1, 3, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, 5, 6</td></tr><tr><td>Mode</td><td>Used to summarise categorical data set, the mode is the most frequent item in a data set.<br/><br/>In some data sets there may be two modes or more. For example see the data set below:<br/><br/>1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4<br/><br/>The modal values in this case would be both 1 and 2 (it is bimodal / multimodal)<br/><br/>Similarly, in some data sets there may be no mode when all the values appear with similar frequency, see below:<br/><br/>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6<br/><br/>The mode is not used as much for continuous variables because with this type of variable, it is likely that no value will appear more than once (e.g. if you ask 20 people their personal income in the previous year, it's possible that many will have amounts of income that are very close, but that you will never get exactly the same value for two people).</td></tr><tr><td>Mean</td><td>The mean is calculated by adding all the items of a data set together and dividing by the number of items.  <br/><br/>For example in the following data set<br/><br/>1, 2, 2, 2, 3<br/><br/>mean = (1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3) / 5<br/>mean = 10 / 5<br/>mean = 2<br/><br/>Unlike the median or the mode, the mean is sensitive to a change in any value of the data set.   The mean is sensitive to outliers and skewed data.<br/><br/>Note: this is the arithmetic mean (as opposed other means such as the geometric, harmonic, and generalised means</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>The Range	is the difference between the largest and smallest observed value.<br/> <br/>The table below summarises the appropriate method of summarising the middle or typical value of a data set depending on the measurement scale.<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid2"><thead><tr><th><b>Measurement scale</b></th><th><b>	Measure of central tendency</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Categorical</td><td>Mode</td></tr><tr><td>Nominal</td><td>	Mode</td></tr><tr><td>Ordinal</td><td>	Median or mode</td></tr><tr><td>Interval 	(Normal distribution)</td><td>Mean (preferable), median, or mode</td></tr><tr><td>Interval (Skewed data)</td><td>Median</td></tr><tr><td>Ratio (Normal distribution)</td><td>Mean (preferable), median, or mode</td></tr><tr><td>Ratio (Skewed data)</td><td>Median</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div>
