The data from the 19 trials is represented in the diagram below:<br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/img035.jpg"/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/>What conclusions can be drawn from this diagram?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Publication bias is suggested</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Publication bias is suggested</b>. This conclusion can be drawn from a funnel plot (which we assume the diagram to be), where there is an asymmetry in the distribution of studies. In this case, it suggests that smaller studies with negative results have not been published, hence indicating publication bias. <br/><br/>Discussing the other options:<br/><br/><b>None of the studies were statistically significant</b>: This statement cannot be concluded without knowledge about the p-values or confidence intervals of each study. The plot only provides a visual representation of study size and effect size, but does not give clear information on statistical significance.<br/><br/><b>There is a positive correlation between study size and the clinical benefit from prokinetics</b>: A funnel plot does not typically provide information on correlation between study size and clinical benefit. It's designed to detect potential publication bias or systematic heterogeneity among included studies. Correlation would require a different type of analysis.<br/><br/><b>The results of the smaller trials were falsified</b>: This is an unfounded accusation based solely on the data provided in such a plot. While publication bias may suggest that negative results from small trials are underrepresented, it does not directly imply any falsification of data.<br/><br/><b>Six of the studies showed no benefit from prokinetics in GORD</b>: Without specific data points or more detailed information from the diagram, it isn't possible to definitively state how many studies showed no benefit from prokinetics in GORD. The funnel plot primarily serves to highlight potential biases or heterogeneities within a meta-analysis rather than individual trial outcomes.<br/><br/></div>
