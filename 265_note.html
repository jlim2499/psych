The model consists of two parts that are of equal importance.  The first, the ‘thinking part’, consists of three fundamental questions that are essential for guiding improvement work. The second part, the ‘doing part’, is made up of Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycles that will help you make rapid change. <br/><br/><b>Three fundamental questions:</b><br/><br/>The three fundamental questions for achieving improvement provide a structured and effective approach to driving positive change. These questions align closely with models such as the PDSA cycle and emphasise clarity, measurement, and actionable change.<br/><br/>1) What are we trying to accomplish?<br/><br/>This step focuses on defining clear, measurable goals. Having a well-articulated aim ensures that everyone involved understands the intended outcomes. For instance, in healthcare, this might involve reducing patient wait times by a specific percentage or improving medication adherence rates. Clarity in objectives creates a shared vision and purpose.<br/><br/>2) How will we know that a change is an improvement?<br/><br/>Measurement is central to determining whether a change has led to improvement. Selecting appropriate metrics ensures that progress can be tracked and assessed. For example, you might measure patient satisfaction scores, clinical outcomes, or process efficiency. This step ensures accountability and helps in identifying whether the intervention is achieving its intended impact.<br/><br/>3) What changes can we make that can lead to an improvement?<br/><br/>This is the action-oriented step, where specific strategies or interventions are identified. Drawing on evidence-based practices, team brainstorming, or adapting successful methods from other contexts allows for innovative problem-solving. For example, implementing electronic prescribing to reduce medication errors might be a change you choose to trial.<br/><br/><b>PDSA cycle:</b><br/><br/>The Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle is a widely used method in quality improvement processes within healthcare, including psychiatry. It provides a structured framework for testing changes and implementing improvements in clinical practice.<br/><br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><a class="fancybox" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb196b.png" rel="group"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb196.png"/></a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"><a class="fancybox lbmagglasslink" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb196b.png" rel="group"><img src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/>Plan:<br/><br/>In this phase, the objective is to identify a problem or area for improvement and plan a change aimed at addressing it. This involves defining the specific aim, outlining the steps necessary to implement the change, and predicting the possible outcomes. A clear plan should include who will be involved, what resources are required, and a timeline for implementation.<br/><br/>Do:<br/><br/>The 'Do' phase involves implementing the planned change on a small scale. This might involve a pilot study or a trial run. It is important to collect data throughout this phase to capture the impact of the change and any issues encountered. This real-world testing helps to ensure that any unforeseen problems can be identified and addressed early.<br/><br/>Study:<br/><br/>During the 'Study' phase, the data collected during the 'Do' phase is analysed to determine whether the change has led to the desired improvement. This involves comparing the results to the predictions made during the planning stage. It is crucial to consider both quantitative and qualitative data to get a comprehensive understanding of the change's impact.<br/><br/>Act:<br/><br/>In the 'Act' phase, the findings from the 'Study' phase are used to decide the next steps. If the change was successful, it might be implemented on a larger scale or standardised across the practice. If the change did not lead to the expected improvement, the cycle begins again, using the insights gained to refine the plan and test a new change.<br/><br/>The PDSA cycle is iterative, meaning it is repeated multiple times to continuously refine and improve processes. This approach allows for incremental changes, reducing the risk associated with large-scale implementation and fostering a culture of continuous improvement.<br/><br/>Key features of PDSA cycles include:<br/><br/><ul><li>Iterative cycles - To achieve an iterative approach, multiple PDSA cycles must occur. Lessons learned from one cycle link and inform cycles that follow. Depending on the knowledge gained from a PDSA cycle, the following cycle may seek to modify, expand, adopt or abandon a change that was tested</li><li>Prediction-based test of change - A prediction of the outcome of a change is developed in the ‘plan’ stage of a cycle. This change is then tested and examined by comparison of results with the prediction</li><li>Small-scale testing - As certainty of success of a test of change is not guaranteed, PDSAs start small in scale and build in scale as confidence grows. This allows the change to be adapted according to feedback, minimises risk and facilitates rapid change and learning</li><li>Use of data over time - Data over time increases understanding regarding the variation inherent in a complex healthcare system. Use of data over time is necessary to understand the impact of a change on the process or outcome of interest</li><li>Documentation - Documentation is crucial to support local learning and transferability of learning to other settings</li></ul></div></div>
