After receiving subjects responses,  investigators need to convert the collected information into a well-structured questionnaire. This questionnaire is used as the survey instrument for the second round of data collection. <br/><br/>In the second round, each Delphi participant receives a second questionnaire and is asked to review the items summarized by the investigators based on the information provided in the first round. Accordingly,  <br/>Delphi panellists may be required to rate or rank-order items to establish preliminary priorities among items.  As a result of round two, areas of disagreement and agreement are  identified<br/><br/>In the third round, each Delphi panellist receives a   questionnaire   that   includes   the   items   and   ratings   summarized by the investigator in the previous round and are  asked  to  revise  his/her  judgements  or  to  specify  the  reasons  for  remaining  outside  the  consensus This  round  gives  Delphi  panellists  an  opportunity  to  make  further  clarifications  of  both  the  information and their judgements of the relative importance of the items.  However, compared to the previous round, only a slight increase in the degree of consensus can be expected.<br/><br/>Choosing the appropriate subjects is the most important step in the entire process because it directly relates to the quality of the results generated, despite this, there is no exact criterion currently listed in the literature concerning the selection of Delphi participants. Delphi subjects should be highly trained and competent within the specialized area of knowledge related to the target issue.<br/><br/><b>Potential issues</b><br/><br/>Issues with the Delphi method include:<br/><br/><ul><li>a Delphi study can be time-consuming as several days or weeks may pass between rounds</li><li>the potential  exists  for  low  response  rates  and  striving  to  maintain  robust  feedback  can  be  a  challenge</li><li>the  Delphi  technique  can  potentially enable investigators to mould opinions    </li><li>the   expertise   of   Delphi   panelists  could  be  unevenly  distributed</li></ul></div></div>
