<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Read the following about the study (Gurillo, 2015) on tobacco use and psychosis and then answer the question that follows.<br/>Background: <br/><br/>Although the association between psychotic illness and cigarette smoking is well known, the reasons are unclear why people with psychosis are more likely to smoke than are the general population. We aimed to test several hypotheses. First, that daily tobacco use is associated with an increased risk of psychotic illness in both case-control and prospective studies. Second, that smoking is associated with an earlier age at onset of psychotic illness. Finally, that an earlier age at initiation of smoking is associated with an increased risk of psychosis. We also aimed to derive an estimate of the prevalence of smoking in patients presenting with their first episode of psychosis. <br/><br/>Methods: <br/><br/>We searched Embase, Medline, an d PsycINFO and selected observational studies in which rates of smoking were reported in people with psychotic disorders, compared with controls. We calculated the weighted mean difference for age at onset of psychosis and age at initiation of smoking. For categorical outcomes, we calculated odds ratios from cross-sectional studies and risk ratios from prospective studies. <br/><br/>We calculated the weighted mean difference for continuous data, which were age at onset of psychosis and age at initiation of smoking. For the categorical outcomes of rates of tobacco use in patients and controls, we calculated odds ratios from cross-sectional data and relative risks from prospective data. We used a random-effects model in all analyses because we expected the data to be heterogeneous across studies. <br/><br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><a class="fancybox" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb026b.png" rel="group"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb026.png"/></a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"><a class="fancybox lbmagglasslink" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb026b.png" rel="group"><img src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/><i>Gurillo (2015) Does tobacco use cause psychosis? Systematic review and meta-analysis. Lancet Psychiatry 2015; 2: 71825.</i> <br/><br/><b>QUESTION</b><br/><br/>Based on the above information, how many studies had results that were not significant? <br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">4</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>4</b>. Four studies had results that were not significant.<br/><br/>To determine which studies were significant in the provided meta-analysis, you need to examine the forest plot and look at the confidence intervals (CIs) for each study. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:<br/><br/>Locate the Confidence Intervals (CIs): Each study is represented by a horizontal line and a square or diamond in the forest plot. The line represents the 95% confidence interval, and the square or diamond represents the point estimate (e.g., odds ratio).<br/><br/>Assess the Confidence Intervals Relative to the Line of No Effect: The line of no effect in a forest plot is typically set at an odds ratio of 1 (for studies measuring odds ratios). This vertical line indicates no difference between the compared groups.<br/><br/>Significance Determination:<br/><br/>A study is considered statistically significant if its 95% confidence interval does not cross the line of no effect (the vertical line at 1). This means the entire horizontal line (confidence interval) for that study is either entirely to the left or right of the line of no effect.<br/><br/>A study is considered not statistically significant if its 95% confidence interval crosses the line of no effect. This means part of the horizontal line (confidence interval) is on one side of the line of no effect and part is on the other side.<br/>Using this method, you can visually determine the significance of each study:<br/><br/>For each study listed in the forest plot, look at where the horizontal line (confidence interval) falls in relation to the vertical line of no effect (odds ratio of 1).<br/><br/>Count the studies whose confidence intervals cross the vertical line of no effect. These are the non-significant studies.<br/>From the provided image, the significant studies can be identified as follows:<br/><br/>Significant Studies: The studies where the horizontal lines (confidence intervals) do not cross the vertical line (odds ratio of 1).<br/><br/>Non-significant Studies: The studies where the horizontal lines (confidence intervals) cross the vertical line (odds ratio of 1).<br/><br/>By applying this method to the given forest plot, you can accurately determine that four studies had results that were not significant.<br/><br/></div>
