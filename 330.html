<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A researcher conducts a study looking into the number of cigarettes smoked each day by inpatients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The results are normally distributed with a mean of 20 and a standard deviation of 3. Approximately 95% of the distribution would be found between what two numbers?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">14 and 26</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>14 and 26</b>. Approximately 95% of the distribution lies within two standard deviations of the mean in a normal distribution. Given the mean (μ) is 20 and the standard deviation (σ) is 3, the range can be calculated as follows:<br/><br/>Lower bound = μ - 2σ = 20 - 2(3) = 20 - 6 = 14<br/>Upper bound = μ + 2σ = 20 + 2(3) = 20 + 6 = 26<br/><br/>Therefore, 95% of the distribution would be found between 14 and 26.<br/></div>
