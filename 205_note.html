Taking a sample is generally preferred.<br/><br/>It's important however that the sample that is taken accurately represents the population from which it is drawn.<br/><br/><b>Main types of sampling methods</b><br/><br/>Sampling can either be based on taking random samples or by alternative means. Random samples are preferred.<br/><br/>The table below illustrates the two main types of sampling technique along with the main examples of each.<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid1"><thead><tr><th>Probability (random) sampling</th><th>Non-probability (non-random) sampling</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Simple random sampling<br/>Systematic sampling<br/>Cluster sampling<br/>Stratified sampling<br/>Multistage sampling</td><td>Voluntary sampling<br/>Convenience sampling<br/>Snowball sampling<br/>Quota sampling</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/><b> Non-probability (non-random) sampling</b><br/><br/>These are sometimes called judgement samples. They are based on human choice rather than random selection. In these samples, the probability of each population element is not known. They are convenient and cheaper than probability sampling methods.<br/><br/>Voluntary sampling<br/><br/>These samples are made of people who self-select. For example, people are invited to participate in an online poll. The sample is chosen by the participants and not the survey administrator<br/><br/>Convenience sampling<br/><br/>The sample is made up of people who are easy to reach. For example, people are approached whilst they drink coffee at a hospital cafe and asked about their view on healthcare. This may have been done as the researcher worked at the hospital and it was a convenient way to recruit subjects.<br/><br/>Snowball sampling<br/><br/>This is where one case identifies another of its kind. This is often done in marginalised groups such as intravenous drug users or sex workers.<br/><br/>Quota sampling<br/><br/>Here, the population is divided into groups (strata) and then elements are selected. This is done to ensure that the sample reflects characteristics of the population. For example, a researcher may want to ensure that a sample has a proportionate representation of males and females when compared to the population from which it is drawn. It is similar to a stratified sample except that it does not involve random sampling. Elements are selected by availability and the aim is just to fill the quotas.<br/><br/><b>Probability (random) sampling</b><br/><br/>Probability sampling gives a much more representative sample of the population than non-probability sampling.<br/><br/>In each probability sampling technique, each population element has a known (non-zero) chance of being selected for the sample<br/><br/>Simple random sampling<br/><br/>A simple random sample is a sample in which every member of the population has an equal chance of being chosen.<br/><br/>These samples are often harder to achieve than you think. Imagine you were at a conference and wanted to sample the delegates to see which their favourite lecture had been. You walk about at lunch time and try and pick people at random. You may not realise that a proportion of the population are out smoking, others have gone out to explore the local area. You avoid some people as they appear too miserable to be approached and others simply refuse to speak to you as they think you are weird. Consequently, each member of the population does not have the same chance of being included in the sample.<br/><br/>To conduct a random sample, each member of the population is assigned a unique identification number and then random selected. This is often done with a random number generator.<br/><br/>Systematic sampling<br/><br/>In systematic sampling, every kth member of the population gets selected for the sample. Say you had a population of 200 and wanted a sample of 10, then every 20th member would be selected.<br/><br/>This could be applied to the conference example (given above) as every 20th delegate could be selected as they were leaving the conference centre at the end of the day.<br/><br/>Systematic sampling is easier to conduct than simple random sampling but is more prone to bias if there is a pattern in the population that is consistent with the sampling frequency. For example, imagine you wanted to sample the drinking patterns of junior doctors by estimating their weekly intake. If you selected a regular sampling time (for example monthly) this might coincide with pay day which is a time when evenings out tend to occur which would be associated with greater alcohol consumption.<br/><br/>Cluster sampling<br/><br/>Cluster sampling involves dividing a population into separate groups (called clusters). A random sample of clusters is then selected and each element included in the final sample.<br/><br/>This is really useful when clusters are located in such a way as to facilitate easy collection of data. For example, say you wanted to investigate the opinions of operating room assistants. It would be much easier to go to a selection of hospitals and interview all the assistants in one go rather than drawing up a list and travelling across the country to interview assistants located in various regions.<br/><br/>Stratified sampling<br/><br/>In stratified sampling, an entire population is first divided into groups (strata) and then a random sample taken from each strata.<br/><br/>Strata could be groups such as males or females or age groups. This ensures that one can obtain equal numbers of different individuals.<br/><br/>This ensures that the final sample has certain characteristics of the population. For example, you might want to establish the different salaries of doctors. You might know that 30% of all doctors are GPs and so would obtain a sample with 30% GPs.<br/><br/>Multi-stage sampling<br/><br/>This is more complex method of sampling that involves several stages. Two or more sampling methods are combined. This method allows you to narrow down a large population<br/><br/>Example A<br/><br/>Stage 1  randomly select 5 counties (cluster)<br/>Stage 2  randomly select 2 hospitals within each county (cluster)<br/>Stage 3  interview every 10th person to enter the hospital (systematic)<br/><br/>Example B<br/><br/>Stage 1  randomly select 6 pharmacies within a city (cluster)<br/>Stage 2  within each pharmacy select 10 prescriptions that occurred in the previous month to see how much was spent on each prescription (simple random sample)</div></div>
