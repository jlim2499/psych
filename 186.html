<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is true regarding descriptive and inferential statistics?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">An estimate of a population mean accompanied with a confidence interval is an inferential statistic</span></div><br/>The correct answer is: <b>An estimate of a population mean accompanied with a confidence interval is an inferential statistic</b>. Inferential statistics are used to make inferences or predictions about a population based on data obtained from a sample. When we calculate the mean of a sample and accompany it with a confidence interval, we are using inferential statistics. The confidence interval provides us with an estimated range of values which is likely to include the unknown population parameter.<br/><br/><b>Inferential statistics are used to summarise data obtained from a population sample</b> is incorrect because this statement describes descriptive statistics, not inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics are used to summarise, organise and simplify data obtained from either a sample or an entire population.<br/><br/><b>Descriptive statistics involves the use of hypothesis testing</b> is incorrect as it's actually inferential statistics that involve hypothesis testing. Hypothesis testing allows us to make decisions or draw conclusions about populations based on sample data.<br/><br/>The statement <b>Inferential statistics are limited to samples and do not provide relevant information about the population from which the sample is drawn</b> is also incorrect. While it's true that inferential statistics are used primarily with samples, they absolutely provide relevant information about the population - in fact, their main purpose is to allow for predictions or generalisations about the population based on sample data.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Descriptive statistics enable predictions to be made about a population from a sample</b> is incorrect because this again describes inferential, not descriptive, statistics. Descriptive statistics summarise and describe characteristics of a dataset but do not allow for making predictions or generalising results beyond that dataset.<br/><br/></div>
