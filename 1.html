<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>When examining a patient you find that they resist your attempts to move their body parts.  What type of behaviour are they displaying?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Negativism</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Obstruction is the motor counterpart of thought block</div>The correct answer is <b>Negativism</b>. Negativism refers to a behaviour in which a person resists attempts to be moved or does the opposite of what is asked. It is commonly seen in catatonic states, often associated with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.<br/><br/>Discussing the incorrect answers:<br/><br/><b>Logoclonia</b> is not the correct answer. Logoclonia refers to the repetition of the last syllables of a word, especially when speaking quickly. This condition is often observed in patients suffering from neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.<br/><br/><b>Logorrhoea</b>, another incorrect option, describes excessive and often rapid speech that can be difficult for others to interrupt or comprehend. It is commonly associated with manic episodes in bipolar disorder or pressured speech.<br/><br/><b>Obstruction</b> doesn't refer to a type of behaviour but rather a physical blockage or hindrance within a structure or passageway in the body. In medical terms, it could refer to conditions such as bowel obstruction or airway obstruction which are quite different from behavioural manifestations.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Coprolalia</b> is incorrect as well. Coprolalia involves involuntary swearing or the utterance of inappropriate remarks. It's one of the symptoms most commonly associated with Tourette syndrome, although only a minority of people with Tourette's actually exhibit this symptom.<br/><br/>In conclusion, negativism best fits the description given in the question, indicating resistance towards attempts at moving body parts. The other options represent different behavioural attributes or medical conditions unrelated to resistive behaviour.<br/></div>
