These plots graph the size of the effects found in individual studies against a measure of the study's precision or size. In the absence of publication bias, the plot is expected to resemble an inverted funnel, where studies with high precision (often larger studies) cluster at the top, near the average effect size, and less precise studies (often smaller studies) scatter more widely at the bottom. A skewed or asymmetrical funnel plot can suggest the presence of publication bias, indicating that studies with certain results are disproportionately represented in the published literature.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Demonstrate the heterogeneity of a meta-analysis: While funnel plots might incidentally reflect heterogeneity, they are not primarily used for this purpose. Other statistical methods, such as the I-squared statistic, are specifically designed to quantify heterogeneity.<br/><br/>Provide a graphical representation of the relative risk results in a case-control study: Funnel plots are not typically used to display results of a single case-control study but could be used to display results from a meta-analysis of multiple case-control studies.<br/><br/>Provide a graphical representation of the relative risk results in a cohort study: Similar to case-control studies, funnel plots are not used for individual cohort studies but can be used in meta-analyses of cohort studies.<br/><br/>Provide a graphical representation of the probability of a patient experiencing a particular adverse effect: This is not the primary use of funnel plots. Individual study results, such as the probability of adverse effects, would be displayed in different types of plots or charts specific to the outcomes of a single study.<br/></div>
