Do not panic, equipped with a basic understanding you will be able to select the right answer without fully understanding the statistics which underpin it.<br/><br/><b>Steps for identifying the appropriate test:</b><br/><br/> To find the correct test follow these three steps:<br/><br/><ul><li>Step 1 → Define the research question (correlation or difference)</li><li>Step 2 → Establish how many groups there are and if dependent or independent</li><li>Step 3 → Identify the variables and data types</li><li>Step 4 → Establish if parametric or non-parametric tests should be used</li><li>Step 5 → Select the correct statistical test (as per chart below)</li></ul><br/> Step 1 → Define the research question (correlation or difference):<br/><br/><ul><li>Correlation/Relationship: Are you exploring whether variables are associated or related?<ul><li>Example: Is there a relationship between smoking status and anxiety levels?</li></ul></li><li>Difference Between Groups: Are you comparing two or more groups to identify differences in outcomes?<ul><li>Example: Does a new therapy reduce depression more effectively than standard therapy?</li></ul></li></ul><br/>Step 2 → Establish how many groups there are and if dependent or independent:<br/><br/>When we have independent samples, we assume that the scores of one sample do not affect the other. Each group contains different subjects and there is no meaningful way to pair them.<br/><br/>Dependent samples are related to each other. Dependent samples can occur in two scenarios. In one, a group may be measured twice such as in a pretest-posttest situation (scores on a test before and after the lesson). <br/><br/>The other scenario is one in which an observation in one sample is matched with an observation in the second sample.<br/><br/>For example, suppose quality inspectors want to compare two laboratories to determine whether their blood tests give similar results. They send blood samples drawn from the same 10 children to both labs for analysis.<br/><br/>Because both labs tested blood specimens from the same 10 children, the test results are not independent. To compare the average blood test results from the two labs, the inspectors would need to do a paired t-test, which is based on the assumption that samples are dependent.<br/><br/>One Group:<br/><br/><ul><li>Are you testing a single group against a known value or hypothesis?<ul><li>Example: Is the mean depression score in a single group significantly different from the national average?</li></ul></li></ul><br/>Two Groups:<br/><br/><ul><li>Independent: Groups consist of separate individuals (e.g., treatment vs. placebo groups).<ul><li>Example: Do smokers and non-smokers differ in their anxiety levels?</li></ul></li><li>Dependent/Related: Groups consist of the same individuals tested under different conditions or time points.<ul><li>Example: Do anxiety scores change before and after therapy in the same group of participants?</li></ul></li></ul><br/>Three or More Groups:<br/><br/><ul><li>Independent: Separate groups (e.g., non-smokers, light smokers, heavy smokers).</li><li>Dependent/Related: Repeated measures or matched groups (e.g., blood pressure measured at three time points).</li></ul><br/>Step 3 → Identify the variables and data types:<br/><br/><ul><li>Dependent Variable: The outcome you are measuring (e.g., anxiety score).</li><li>Independent Variable: The factor you are comparing or assessing (e.g., treatment type, smoking status).</li></ul><br/>A variable is any characteristics, number, or quantity that can be measured or counted. A variable may also be called a data item. Age, sex, business income and expenses, country of birth, capital expenditure, class grades, eye colour and vehicle type are examples of variables. It is called a variable because the value may vary between data units in a population.<br/><br/>The three main variables in a typical study are the, independent, dependent and controlled variables.<br/><br/>The independent variable is something that the experimenter purposely changes over the course of the investigation. <br/><br/>The dependent variable is the one that is observed and changes in response to the independent variable. <br/><br/>During the experiment all other variables should be controlled.  The variables that are not changed are called controlled variables.<br/><br/>Dependent variables are affected by independent variables but not by controlled variables as these do not vary throughout the study.<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid1"><thead><tr><th>Data type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Nominal</td><td>Observed values can be put into set categories which have no particular order or hierarchy. You can count but not order or measure nominal data (for example birthplace)</td></tr><tr><td>Ordinal</td><td>Observed values can be put into set categories which themselves can be ordered (for example social class). With ordinal data one cannot state with certainty whether the intervals between each value are equal. For example, on a 10 point scale, the difference between a 9 and a 10 is not necessarily the same difference as the difference between a 6 and a 7</td></tr><tr><td>Interval</td><td>A measurement where the difference between two values is meaningful, such that equal differences between values correspond to real differences between the quantities that the scale measures (for example temperature)<br/><br/>On interval measurement scales, one unit on the scale represents the same magnitude on the trait or characteristic being measured across the whole range of the scale. For example, if depression were measured on an interval scale, then a difference between a score of 10 and a score of 11 would represent the same difference in depression as would a difference between a score of 50 and a score of 51. Interval scales do not have a true zero point, however, and therefore it is not possible to make statements about how many times higher one score is than another. For a depression scale, it would not be valid to say that a person with a score of 30 was twice as depressed as a person with a score of 15. A good example of an interval scale is the Fahrenheit scale for temperature. Equal differences on this scale represent equal differences in temperature, but a temperature of 30 degrees is not twice as warm as one of 15 degrees.<br/> </td></tr><tr><td>Ratio (continuous)</td><td>Like interval scales except they have true zero points (true / meaningful zero points means that 0 relates to the absence of something)<br/><br/>Ratio scales are like interval scales except they have true zero points. A good example is the Kelvin scale of temperature. This scale has an absolute zero. Thus, a temperature of 300 Kelvin is twice as high as a temperature of 150 Kelvin. Other examples of ratio scales include weight, time, and length.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>Step 4 → Establish if parametric or non-parametric tests should be used:<br/><br/>Parametric tests are valid if the following assumptions are met:<br/><br/><ul><li>Normal Distribution:<ul><li>The data should follow a bell-shaped (normal) distribution.</li><li>Applies to continuous (interval/ratio) variables.</li></ul></li><li>Homogeneity of Variance:<ul><li>Variability (spread) within each group should be approximately equal.</li><li>Particularly relevant for tests comparing multiple groups (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA).</li></ul></li><li>Independent Observations:<ul><li>Data points should be independent of each other (no pairing or repeated measures, unless explicitly accounted for).</li></ul></li><li>Scale of Measurement:<ul><li>The dependent variable must be interval or ratio.</li></ul></li></ul><br/>Step 5 → Select the correct statistical test (as per chart below)<br/><br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><a class="fancybox" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb201b.png" rel="group"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb201.png"/></a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"><a class="fancybox lbmagglasslink" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb201b.png" rel="group"><img src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/>Worked example 1:<br/><br/>Study Description - A clinical psychologist is conducting a study to compare the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Mindfulness-Based Therapy in reducing anxiety levels. A total of 60 participants are randomly assigned to one of the two groups. After 8 weeks of treatment, their anxiety levels are assessed using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), which scores anxiety on a scale from 0 to 63. The anxiety scores are found to be normally distributed within each group.<br/><br/><ul><li>Step 1: Define the Research Question (Correlation or Difference)<ul><li>Research Question: Does the type of therapy (CBT vs. Mindfulness-Based Therapy) lead to differences in anxiety levels as measured by the BAI?</li><li>This is a study looking at differences in anxiety levels between two groups.</li></ul></li><li>Step 2: Establish How Many Groups There Are and If They Are Dependent or Independent<ul><li>There are two groups, Group 1: Participants receiving CBT, Group 2: Participants receiving Mindfulness-Based Therapy.</li><li>The groups are independent, as each participant belongs to only one group and there is no repeated measurement or matching.</li></ul></li><li>Step 3: Identify the Variables and Data Types<ul><li>Dependent Variable: Anxiety levels, measured using the BAI (interval/ratio, continuous scale).</li><li>Independent Variable: Therapy type (categorical, nominal with two levels: CBT and Mindfulness-Based Therapy).</li></ul></li><li>Step 4: Establish if Parametric or Non-Parametric Tests Should Be Used<ul><li>Normality Check: The vignette specifies that the BAI scores are normally distributed, satisfying the parametric assumption for normality.</li></ul></li><li>Step 5: Select the Correct Statistical Test<ul><li>From the chart: For two independent groups with normally distributed data: Use an Independent t-test.</li></ul></li></ul><br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>The following data on parametric versus non-parametric tests may also be helpful:<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid2"><thead><tr><th>Level of measurement</th><th>Type of variable</th><th>Recommended analysis</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Nominal</td><td>Qualitative</td><td>	Non-parametric</td></tr><tr><td>Ordinal</td><td>Qualitative</td><td>Non-parametric</td></tr><tr><td>Interval</td><td>Quantitative</td><td>Parametric</td></tr><tr><td>Ratio</td><td>Quantitative</td><td>Parametric</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>Note: sometimes parametric analyses are used for ordinal data such as Likert scales. When looking at experimental data the dependent variable is the one of main concern.<br/><br/>You need to know which tests are parametric and non-parametric (see table below)<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid3"><thead><tr><th>Parametric technique</th><th>Non-parametric alternative</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>None</td><td>Chi-squared for goodness of fit</td></tr><tr><td>None</td><td>Chi-squared for independence</td></tr><tr><td>Independent samples t-test</td><td>Mann-Whitney U</td></tr><tr><td>Paired samples t-test</td><td>Wilcoxon Signed Rank test</td></tr><tr><td>One way between groups ANOVA</td><td>Kruskal-Wallis test</td></tr><tr><td>One way repeated measures ANOVA</td><td>	Friedman test</td></tr><tr><td>Two-way analysis of variance (between groups)</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Mixed between-within groups ANOVA</td><td>	None</td></tr><tr><td>Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)</td><td>None</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/><b>Further information on the tests</b><br/><br/><b>Chi-squared</b><br/><br/>Used to assess differences in categorical variables<br/><br/>Non-parametric test<br/><br/>Applies an assumption that the sample is large (Fisher's exact does not make this assumption and so should be used for small samples although it can be used for both large and small samples)<br/><br/>Compares the observed frequencies against those that would have been expected if there was no difference and then produces a value (the chi squared) which can then be used to assess if the difference is significant (p&lt;0.05).<br/><br/><b>Pearson's correlation coefficient</b><br/><br/><i>(aka Pearson's r, the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient)</i><br/><br/>Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) measures linear correlation (the strength of a linear relationship) between two variables.<br/>The sign of the correlation coefficient tells us the direction of the linear relationship. If r is negative (&lt;0) the correlation is negative and the trend line slopes down. If r is positive (&gt; 0) the correlation is positive and the trend line slopes up. <br/><br/>The size (magnitude) of the correlation coefficient tells us the strength of a linear relationship. <br/><br/><ul><li>If r &gt; 0.90 this implies a strong linear association </li><li>For 0.65 &lt; r &lt; 0.90 this implies a moderate linear association </li><li>If r &lt; 0.65 this implies a weak linear association</li></ul><br/>Pearson's is a parametric test (it assumes that both variables are normally distributed). If the data is non-parametric or if both variables are not ratio variables then Spearman's should be used.<br/><br/><b>T-TESTS:</b><br/><br/>A t-test is used to assess whether the means of two groups have a statistically significant difference.<br/><br/>There are 3 types of t-test:-<br/><br/><ul><li>One sample t-test. This is used to see if there is a difference between a sample mean and a hypothesised population mean (or claimed mean).  For example.  Imagine a farmer was selling bags of fertiliser and claimed that it would cover 14 acres of land (claimed mean).  If you then bought 10 bags of him (sample of 10) and tested each bag and produced your own mean of 13 acres (sample), you would compare these means with a one sample t-test.</li></ul><br/><ul><li>Independent t-test.  This test is used when you want to compare to means from independent groups.  For example.   A study is conducted to see if vitamin tablets cause children to grow. 100 children are split into two groups.  One group is given vitamins and the other a placebo.  The mean height of each group is then taken.  The means are then compared with an independent t-test. </li></ul><br/><ul><li>	Paired t-test. This is used when comparing the means of two groups that are considered to be paired (matched, or dependent).  An example would be a study that first takes the blood pressure from a group of people then gives them a drug and then repeats the blood pressure measurements. This will produce two means from the same sample.  Another example would be a study that tried to prove that people had bigger right hands than left hands.  A sample would be taken and the mean of all the right hands and left hands would be taken and compared.  The aspect that makes the variables paired is that the left and right hands of a single person are taken.</li></ul><br/><b>ANOVA</b>:<br/><br/>ANOVA is a statistical test to demonstrate statistically significant differences between the means of several groups.  It is similar to a student's t-test apart from that ANOVA allows the comparison of more than just two means.<br/><br/>ANOVA assumes that the variable is normally distributed.  The non-parametric equivalents to this method are the Kruskal-Wallis analysis of ranks, the Median test, Friedman's two-way analysis of variance, and Cochran Q test<br/><br/>It works by comparing the variance of the means.  It distinguishes between within group variance (the variance of the sample mean) and between group variance (the variance between the separate sample means).  The null hypothesis assumes that the variance of all the means are the same and that within group variance is the same as between group variance.  The test is based on the ratio of these two variances (known as the F statistic).</div></div>
