To enable meaningful comparison these differences, need to be adjusted for.<br/><br/>The Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) is a ratio between the observed number of deaths in a study population and the number of deaths that would be expected, based on the age- and sex-specific rates in a standard population and the population size of the study population by the same age/sex groups. <br/><br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mma131.png"/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/>An SMR describes whether a specific population (e.g. patients in a certain hospital) are more, less or equally as likely to die than a standard / reference population (e.g. patients in all hospitals across the UK).<br/><br/><b>Interpretation</b><br/><br/><ul><li>SMR &lt; 1.0 indicates there were fewer than expected deaths in the study population</li><li>SMR = 1.0 indicates the number of observed deaths equals the number of expected deaths in the study population</li><li>SMR &gt;1.0 indicates there were more than expected deaths in the study population (excess deaths)</li></ul><br/><i>Note: The SMR is sometimes expressed after multiplying by 100.</i><br/><br/><b>Calculation</b><br/><br/>To calculate:<br/><br/><ul><li>(a) Obtain age, and sex-specific death rates in the standard population</li><li>(b) Need estimate for the number of people in each category for each of the standard and the study populations.</li><li>(c) Calculate the number of expected deaths in each age-sex group of study population (age-sex-specific rates in standard population (step A) x number of people in each category of study population (step B))</li><li>(d) Add all the age- and sex- specific expected deaths to get the expected number of deaths for the whole study population.</li><li>(e) Divide the observed number of deaths by the expected number of deaths</li></ul><br/><b>Direct versus Indirect method</b><br/><br/>The SMR can be standardised using the direct or the indirect method.<br/><br/>Direct method: used when you know the age-sex-specific rates for the study population and the age-sex-structure of the standard population.<br/><br/>Indirect method: used to calculate the SMR when the age-specific rates for the study population are unknown or not available. This method uses the observed number of deaths in the study population and compares this to the number of deaths that would be expected if the age distribution was the same as that of the standard population.<br/><br/><b>Worked example</b><br/><br/>See below for w worked example from Cochrane.org:<br/><br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><a class="fancybox" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb061b.png" rel="group"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb061.png"/></a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"><a class="fancybox lbmagglasslink" data-fancybox="" href="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mmb061b.png" rel="group"><img src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png"/></a></td></tr></tbody></table></center></div></div>
