<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>An indirect association occurs when:<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Two variables are related, but the relationship is mediated by a third variable</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Two variables are related, but the relationship is mediated by a third variable</b>. An indirect association occurs when two variables are genuinely related, but their relationship is explained or mediated by a third variable. For example, socioeconomic status influences health outcomes indirectly through mediating factors like access to healthcare or lifestyle choices.<br/><br/><b>There is no true relationship between two variables</b>: This describes a spurious association, where the observed relationship is false or misleading, often due to a confounder or random chance.<br/><br/><b>The relationship is due to random chance</b>: Random chance can produce spurious associations but does not define an indirect association.<br/><br/><b>One variable directly causes changes in another</b>: This describes a direct association, where the relationship is causal and unmediated by a third variable.<br/><br/><b>The association is observed across multiple studies</b>: Observing an association across studies is related to consistency, a Bradford Hill criterion, and does not define whether the association is direct, indirect, or spurious.<br/></div>
