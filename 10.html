<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A 68-year-old man presents to your clinic with complaints of increasing tremors in his right hand, stiffness, and slowness in his movements. His family mentions that he has had difficulty writing and performing fine motor tasks over the past few months. He also reports trouble with simple tasks like buttoning his shirt and feels his walking has become more 'shuffling'. You suspect Parkinson's disease and decide to perform a Clock Drawing Test as part of his cognitive and motor evaluation.<br/>Which of the following abnormalities is most likely to be observed in this patient's Clock Drawing Test?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Tremulous or shaky lines</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Tremulous or shaky lines</b>. In patients with Parkinson's disease, the characteristic motor symptoms, including tremor and bradykinesia (slowness of movement), often lead to tremulous or shaky lines in the Clock Drawing Test. This reflects the patient's impaired fine motor control, a key feature in Parkinson’s, which may also result in micrographia (small, cramped handwriting). This is a typical early sign of motor dysfunction that can help clinicians distinguish Parkinson’s disease from other neurodegenerative conditions.<br/><br/><b>Crowding of numbers on one side of the clock</b>: This type of visuospatial error is more typically seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease or other dementias where cognitive impairments predominate. It is less common in Parkinson’s disease, which is primarily a movement disorder, although cognitive decline can occur later in its progression.<br/><br/><b>Hands set to the incorrect time</b>: Incorrect time setting can occur in conditions like Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia due to deficits in executive function, attention, and memory. It is not a typical early feature of Parkinson's disease, where motor symptoms are more prominent than cognitive impairment in the early stages.<br/><br/><b>Omission of one half of the clock face</b>: This error is indicative of hemispatial neglect, which is typically associated with right parietal lobe damage, often following a stroke. It is not a characteristic finding in Parkinson’s disease, which primarily affects motor function.<br/><br/><b>Misplacement of numbers</b>: Misplacement of numbers around the clock face is more commonly observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease or other dementias, where visuospatial and executive dysfunction is prominent. In contrast, Parkinson’s disease initially affects motor control, and visuospatial deficits are less common in the early stages.<br/></div>
