A Kappa score of 1 indicates perfect agreement between two observers, meaning they are in complete concordance across all categories without any disagreement or reliance on chance.<br/><br/><b>10</b>: This is not a valid Kappa value. Kappa scores range between -1 and 1, with 1 indicating perfect agreement, 0 indicating agreement no better than chance, and -1 indicating perfect disagreement.<br/><br/><b>-10</b>: This is also not a valid Kappa value, as the range of Kappa is limited to -1 to 1. Negative values indicate disagreement, but a score of -10 is outside the theoretical boundaries of Kappa.<br/><br/><b>Zero</b>: A Kappa score of 0 suggests that the agreement observed between the two observers is no better than what would be expected by chance. This does not indicate complete agreement.<br/><br/><b>100</b>: Kappa is not expressed as a percentage and cannot take a value of 100. Scores are limited to the range of -1 to 1, with 1 representing complete agreement.<br/></div>
