<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is one of the advantages of a longitudinal study design?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Reduces recall bias</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Reduces recall bias</b>. A longitudinal study design involves repeated observations of the same variables (e.g., people) over short or long periods of time. This design helps in reducing recall bias, which is a systematic error caused by differences in the accuracy or completeness of the recollections retrieved ('recalled') by study participants regarding events or experiences from the past. By regularly monitoring participants, researchers can collect data as it occurs, thereby minimising errors that may arise from participants' forgetfulness or misinterpretation of past events.<br/><br/><b>Limits sample attrition</b> is not necessarily an advantage of longitudinal studies. Sample attrition refers to the dropout rate of participants over time. In fact, longitudinal studies often face high rates of sample attrition due to their extended duration, which can lead to less representative samples and potential bias in results.<br/><br/>The option <b>Quick</b> does not describe an advantage of longitudinal studies. On the contrary, these types of studies are often time-consuming due to their nature of studying changes over a period of time which could range from months to years.<br/><br/>Similarly, <b>Inexpensive</b> is not an accurate description for longitudinal studies. They are typically costlier than cross-sectional studies because they involve repeated measures and sustained engagement with participants over a prolonged period.<br/><br/>Lastly, saying that <b>They only require small sample sizes</b> is incorrect. Longitudinal studies usually require larger sample sizes due to expected participant drop-out over time. Larger initial samples help ensure that even after attrition, there will still be enough data for meaningful analysis.<br/><br/></div>
