<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A masters student had noticed that nearly all of her patients with panic disorder were married. She was keen to investigate this further to see if there was an association.<br/>She selected 100 patients with panic disorder and 100 controls.  Of the 100 patients with panic disorder, 85 were married.  Of the 100 controls, only 60 were married.<br/><br/>What is the odds ratio?<br/><br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">3.77</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>3.77</b>. The odds ratio (OR) is calculated by comparing the odds of being married among those with panic disorder to the odds of being married among the control group.<br/><br/>To calculate the odds ratio:<br/><br/>For the panic disorder group: 85 married out of 100, so the odds of being married is 85/15 = 5.67.<br/><br/>For the control group: 60 married out of 100, so the odds of being married is 60/40 = 1.5.<br/><br/>The odds ratio is then calculated as 5.67 / 1.5 = 3.77.<br/><br/>This indicates that patients with panic disorder have 3.77 times higher odds of being married compared to the control group.<br/><br/><b>0.26</b>: This value is too low and would suggest that being married is much less common among those with panic disorder than in controls, which is inconsistent with the data showing a high proportion of married individuals in the panic disorder group.<br/><br/><b>1.41</b>: This odds ratio is closer to 1, suggesting a weaker association between marriage and panic disorder than the data supports. Given the higher percentage of married individuals in the panic disorder group, this odds ratio is insufficient to reflect the observed difference.<br/><br/><b>0.52</b>: This value also suggests that marriage is less common in the panic disorder group than in controls, which contradicts the data provided.<br/><br/><b>2.95</b>: Although closer to the correct value, this odds ratio still underestimates the strength of the association between panic disorder and being married, as calculated from the data.<br/><br/>Ensure that the odds ratio is interpreted correctly in clinical settings, as understanding the association between conditions like panic disorder and sociodemographic factors such as marital status may inform treatment approaches and psychosocial support in psychiatric practice.<br/></div>
