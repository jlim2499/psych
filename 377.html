<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A community psychiatrist is keen to know how long patients with depression continue to be prescribed antidepressants by their general practitioner. They conduct a study and discover that the median duration of a prescription is 6 months with an interquartile range of 3 to 12 months. Based on these results, which of the following is true?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">25% of patients are prescribed antidepressants for less than 3 months</span></div><br/>The correct answer is '<b>25% of patients are prescribed antidepressants for less than 3 months</b>'. This statement is true because the interquartile range, which represents the middle 50% of data points in a dataset, is from 3 to 12 months. This means that the lower quartile (the 25th percentile) is at 3 months and thus, 25% of patients are prescribed antidepressants for less than this value.<br/><br/>The statement '<b>The lower quartile for the data set is 6 months</b>' is incorrect. The lower quartile, also known as Q1 or the first quartile, refers to the middle number between the smallest number in a dataset and its median. In this case, it's mentioned that the interquartile range lies between 3 to 12 months which implies that the lower quartile (Q1) is at 3 months not at 6 months. <br/><br/>'<b>75% of patients are prescribed antidepressants for 3 to 12 months</b>' is also incorrect. The interquartile range represents only the middle half (or approximately 50%) of all data points in a dataset, not three-quarters or 75%. Therefore, it cannot be stated with certainty that three-quarters of all patients have been prescribed antidepressants within this time frame.<br/><br/>The option '<b>The upper quartile for the data set is 15 months</b>' is incorrect as well. The upper quartile, or Q3, marks off the lowest quarter of data from the highest quarter in a dataset. Here it's given as part of an interquartile range which spans from 3 to 12 months implying that Q3 or upper quartile occurs at month twelve not fifteen.<br/><br/>Finally, saying '<b>50% of patients are prescribed antidepressants for more than 12 months</b>' is also incorrect. The median, which is the middle value that separates the higher half from the lower half of a dataset, is given as 6 months. This means that 50% of patients are prescribed antidepressants for less than or equal to 6 months and not more than 12 months.<br/></div>
