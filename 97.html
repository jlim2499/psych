<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which one of the following significance tests is used to analyse data which is measured and follows a normal distribution?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Independent t-test</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Independent t-test</b>.<br/><br/>The independent t-test is used to compare the means of two independent groups when the data is continuous and follows a normal distribution. For example, comparing the mean depression scores of patients treated with two different antidepressants.<br/><br/>Explanations for Incorrect Options:<br/><br/><b>Chi-squared test</b>: The chi-squared test is used for categorical data rather than continuous data. It evaluates whether there is an association between two categorical variables (e.g., gender and response to treatment).<br/><br/><b>Spearman's rank correlation coefficient</b>: This test is used to measure the strength and direction of association between two ranked (ordinal) variables or continuous data that do not meet the assumptions of normality. It is not appropriate for normally distributed data.<br/><br/><b>Wilcoxon matched-pairs</b>: The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a non-parametric test used to compare paired samples, such as pre- and post-treatment scores in the same individuals. It is used when the data is not normally distributed.<br/><br/><b>Mann-Whitney test</b>: This is a non-parametric test used to compare differences between two independent groups when the data does not meet the assumptions of normality. It is not suitable for normally distributed data.<br/></div>
