This method does not give each member of the population an equal chance of being included in the sample, hence it is considered a non-random sampling method. Therefore, Option 5 is the correct answer.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Multistage sampling: Multistage sampling is a form of probability sampling that involves randomly selecting clusters or groups and then taking further random samples within those clusters. It involves random elements and is not a non-random sampling method.<br/><br/>Stratified sampling: In stratified sampling, the researcher divides the population into strata based on certain characteristics, and then samples are taken randomly from each stratum. Although the initial stratification is based on non-random criteria, the actual selection of participants within each stratum is random.<br/><br/>Cluster sampling: This involves dividing the population into clusters and then randomly selecting some of those clusters for inclusion in the sample. All individuals within the chosen clusters are then included in the sample. The selection of clusters is done randomly, making it a random sampling method.<br/><br/>Systematic sampling: Systematic sampling is a type of probability sampling where the first element is chosen randomly from a list, and then subsequent elements are selected using a fixed interval. This method also involves a random component and is considered a random sampling method.<br/></div>
