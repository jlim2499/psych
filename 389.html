<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>A study aimed to investigate the relationship between excessive alcohol consumption and the development of liver cirrhosis. Out of 100 excessive drinkers, 80 were found to have liver cirrhosis. In contrast, out of 100 individuals who did not drink alcohol excessively, only 20 were diagnosed with liver cirrhosis. Calculate the odds of having liver cirrhosis for excessive drinkers compared to non-excessive drinkers.<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">16</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Odds - remember a ratio of the number of people who incur a particular outcome to the number of people who do not incur the outcome<br/><br/>NOT a ratio of the number of people who incur a particular outcome to the total number of people</div>Odds of cirrhosis in excessive drinkers = number with cirrhosis / number without cirrhosis in drinkers = 80/20.<br/><br/>Odds of cirrhosis in non-excessive drinkers = number with cirrhosis / number without cirrhosis in non-drinkers = 20/80.<br/><br/>OR = Odds in drinkers (exposed) / Odds in non-drinkers (non-exposed)<br/><br/>OR= (80/20) / (20/80)<br/><br/>OR= 16<br/><br/>The odds ratio quantifies the strength of the association between excessive drinking and the occurrence of liver cirrhosis.<br/><br/>The odds of having liver cirrhosis for excessive drinkers compared to non-excessive drinkers is 16. This means that excessive drinkers have 16 times the odds of having liver cirrhosis compared to those who do not drink excessively.<br/></div>
