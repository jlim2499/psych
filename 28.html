<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>The proportion of the disease in a population that could be eliminated if the exposure responsible for the disease was removed is the definition of which term?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Population attributable risk</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Population attributable risk</b>. This term refers to the proportion of the disease in a population that could be eliminated if the exposure responsible for the disease was removed. In clinical terms, understanding this concept is crucial for public health efforts. For example, if a high proportion of lung cancer cases in a population are attributable to smoking, interventions targeting smoking cessation could significantly reduce the overall incidence of lung cancer.<br/><br/><b>Risk ratio</b> (also known as relative risk) measures the risk of an event occurring in the exposed group compared to the unexposed group. While useful for comparing groups, it does not reflect the overall impact of removing the exposure on the entire population.<br/><br/><b>Attributable risk</b> measures the difference in disease rates between the exposed and unexposed groups. While this helps identify the risk caused by exposure, it doesn’t estimate the broader population-level impact of eliminating the exposure.<br/><br/><b>Odds ratio</b> compares the odds of an event in two groups and is typically used in case-control studies. However, it doesn’t measure the proportion of the disease that could be eliminated at a population level.<br/><br/><b>Attributable proportion</b> is the proportion of disease among the exposed group that is due to the exposure. It’s not focused on the entire population but just on the exposed group.<br/></div>
