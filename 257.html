The incidence rate is calculated by dividing the number of new cases of a disease by the total amount of person-time at risk during the study period. This measure accounts for the fact that not all individuals are followed for the same length of time and that some may enter or leave the study (or develop the disease) at various points throughout the study period.<br/><br/><b>The number of disease-free people at the beginning of a specified time period</b> is incorrect because incidence rate calculations must account for the varying amount of time that participants spend in the study, which is not captured by a simple count of disease-free individuals at the start.<br/><br/><b>The total number of people in a population</b> is not correct as it does not take into account the time each person is at risk. Incidence rates require person-time data, not just the initial size of the population.<br/><br/><b>The number of new cases in a specified time period</b> is actually the numerator in the calculation of the incidence rate, not the denominator.<br/><br/><b>The number of cases in a defined population at a specified point in time</b> refers to prevalence rather than incidence rate and does not take time at risk into account.<br/></div>
