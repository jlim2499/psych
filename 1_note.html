This can lead to incomplete data sets in meta-analyses which then leads to erroneous conclusions.<br/><br/>Publication bias can be detected by the following graphical methods (Athanasiou 2009):-<br/><br/><ul><li>Funnel plot</li><li>Galbraith plot</li><li>Ordered forest plot</li><li>Normal quantile plot</li></ul><br/>Of these, the most used and the one you absolutely must know about for the exams is the funnel plot.<br/><br/>A funnel plot is a graph used to check for publication bias in systematic reviews and meta-analyses.  They are a form of scatter graph that offers an easy visual way of making sure that the published literature is evenly weighted (drug companies have a habit of withholding data that doesn't support the product). <br/><br/>The x-axis represents some measure of effect size (often a risk ratio) and the y-axis represents some measure of the study size (often the standard error). By convention, the y-axis represents a reverse of the standard error (zero at the top and standard error gets larger towards the bottom). <br/><br/>Each dot on the funnel represents a differ trial in a meta-analysis. Larger trials tend to have smaller standard errors and are located towards the top and smaller studies, with larger standard errors, towards the bottom. <br/><br/>Interpretation<br/><br/><ul><li>A symmetrical, inverted funnel shape indicates that publication bias is unlikely (see below)</li></ul><br/><center><table><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><img class="ajaximage" src="https://d3a7z3xcyhqwt4.cloudfront.net/images_MRCPsychmentor/mma017.png"/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="right"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><br/><ul><li>Conversely, an asymmetrical funnel indicates a relationship between treatment effect and study size. This indicates either publication bias or a systematic difference between smaller and larger studies ('small study effects')</li></ul><br/><i>Athanasiou.
