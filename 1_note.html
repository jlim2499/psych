Exam questions on this topic are common.  Most questions in the paper one exam relate to definitions of the behaviours associated with catatonia.<br/><br/>The following table outlines the key behaviours (Rajagopal, 2007):<br/><br/><div class="table-responsive"><table class="tlarge table table-striped table-bordered" data-role="table" id="tableid1"><thead><tr><th>Behaviour</th><th>Description</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Stupor</td><td>Combination of immobility and mutism.</td><td>A patient sits motionless and mute in a chair for hours without responding to any external stimuli.</td></tr><tr><td>Posturing</td><td>Maintaining the same posture for long periods. A classic example is the 'crucifix'. An extreme version of posturing is catalepsy.</td><td>A patient holds their arm outstretched in a 'crucifix' position for several hours without moving.</td></tr><tr><td>Waxy flexibility (cerea flexibilitas)</td><td>Patient can be positioned in uncomfortable postures, which are maintained for a considerable period of time.</td><td>The examiner raises the patient's arm above their head, and the patient keeps it in that position for an extended period.</td></tr><tr><td>Negativism (Gegenhalten)</td><td>Patient resists the attempts of the examiner to move parts of their body and, according to the original definition, the resistance offered is exactly equal to the strength applied.</td><td>When the examiner tries to lift the patient's arm, the patient resists with exactly the same force, preventing any movement.</td></tr><tr><td>Automatic obedience</td><td>Exaggerated cooperation, automatically obeying every instruction of the examiner.</td><td>The examiner tells the patient to stand up, sit down, and raise their hands, and the patient complies immediately and without question.</td></tr><tr><td>Mitmachen</td><td>A form of automatic obedience whereby the body of the patient can be put into any posture, even if the patient is given instructions to resist. The body part immediately returns to the original position once the force is removed (unlike in waxy flexibility).</td><td>The examiner lifts the patient's arm, which then falls back to its original position as soon as the examiner releases it.</td></tr><tr><td>Mitgehen</td><td>An extreme form of mitmachen in which the examiner is able to move the patient's body with the slightest touch (anglepoise lamp sign), like in mitmachen, the body part returns to the original position once the force is removed.</td><td>The examiner lightly touches the patient's arm, and the arm follows the movement with minimal resistance. Once the touch is removed, the arm returns to its initial position.</td></tr><tr><td>Ambitendency</td><td>The patient alternates between resistance to and cooperation with the examiner's instructions; for example, when asked to shake hands, the patient repeatedly extends and withdraws the hand.</td><td>The patient extends their hand to shake the examiner's hand but then quickly pulls it back, repeating this action several times.</td></tr><tr><td>Psychological pillow</td><td>The patient assumes a reclining posture, with their head a few inches above the bed surface, and is able to maintain this position for prolonged periods.</td><td>The patient lies in bed with their head suspended above the pillow as if resting on an invisible cushion, maintaining this position for an extended time.</td></tr><tr><td>Forced grasping</td><td>The patient forcibly and repeatedly grasps the examiner's hand when offered.</td><td>The examiner offers their hand, and the patient immediately and forcefully grasps it, repeating this action every time the hand is offered.</td></tr><tr><td>Obstruction</td><td>The patient stops suddenly in the course of a movement and is generally unable to give a reason. This appears to be the motor counterpart of thought block.</td><td>While reaching for a glass of water, the patient suddenly stops midway and holds the position without completing the movement.</td></tr><tr><td>Echopraxia</td><td>The patient imitates the actions of the interviewer.</td><td>The examiner raises their hand, and the patient immediately mimics the action, raising their hand in the same way.</td></tr><tr><td>Aversion</td><td>The patient turns away from the examiner when addressed.</td><td>Every time the examiner tries to make eye contact or speak to the patient, the patient turns their head away, avoiding interaction.</td></tr><tr><td>Mannerisms</td><td>These are repetitive, goal-directed movements (e.g. saluting a door or combing hair without a brush in the hand).</td><td>The patient repeatedly salutes the door every time they pass by it.</td></tr><tr><td>Stereotypies</td><td>These are repetitive, regular movements that are not goal-directed (e.g. rocking).</td><td>The patient continuously rocks back and forth while sitting in a chair, without any apparent purpose.</td></tr><tr><td>Motor perseveration</td><td>The patient persists with a particular movement that has lost its initial relevance.</td><td>After picking up a pen, the patient continues the motion of picking up as if there were still a pen to be grasped, even after the pen is securely in hand.</td></tr><tr><td>Echolalia</td><td>Involuntary repetition of language and sounds.</td><td>The examiner says, 'How are you today?' and the patient immediately repeats, 'How are you today?'</td></tr><tr><td>Logorrhoea</td><td>Increased loquacity (talkativeness). Logorrheic speech can be coherent and logical and is not necessarily accelerated in all cases although in severe cases the patient cannot be interrupted.</td><td>A patient with ADHD talks continuously about various topics, making logical connections between ideas, but speaks without pausing for interruptions.</td></tr><tr><td>Logoclonia</td><td>Meaningless repetition of a syllable, particularly an end syllable of a word.</td><td>The patient repeatedly says, 'Please, please, please,' without any contextual relevance.</td></tr><tr><td>Verbigeration</td><td>Meaningless, repetition of words or phrases.</td><td>The patient continuously repeats, 'It's raining cats and dogs,' without any relevance to the current situation.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br/>References:<br/><br/><i>Rajagopal (2007), Catatonia.
