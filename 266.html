<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following best describes an ecological study?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">A study that compares exposure and outcome data at the population or group level</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>A study that compares exposure and outcome data at the population or group level</b>. Ecological studies analyse data at the group or population level rather than the individual level. These studies are often used to examine associations between environmental or societal factors (e.g., air pollution or water quality) and health outcomes (e.g., disease rates) across regions or communities.<br/><br/><b>A study that follows a group of individuals over time to assess the development of outcomes</b>: This is incorrect. This describes a cohort study, where individuals are followed longitudinally to observe the relationship between exposure and outcomes.<br/><br/><b>A study that randomly assigns participants to intervention or control groups</b>: This is incorrect. This describes a randomised controlled trial (RCT), which involves experimental design and random allocation of individuals to study the causal effects of an intervention.<br/><br/><b>A study that collects data at a single point in time from a sample of individuals</b>: This is incorrect. This describes a cross-sectional study, which collects individual-level data to assess both exposure and outcome prevalence simultaneously.<br/><br/><b>A study that compares individuals with a disease to those without to identify risk factors</b>: This is incorrect. This describes a case-control study, which looks retrospectively at exposures among cases (diseased) and controls (non-diseased).<br/></div>
