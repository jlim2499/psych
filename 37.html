Social class is an example of an ordinal variable because it can be categorised and ordered but the differences between categories are not necessarily equal. In other words, while we can say that one social class is higher or lower than another, we cannot quantify the exact difference between them.<br/><br/>Discussing the incorrect options:<br/><br/><b>Random</b> is not a type of variable. It refers to a process where each member of a population has an equal chance of being selected in a study. Therefore, this option is incorrect.<br/><br/><b>Interval</b> variables are numerical values where the difference between two values is meaningful. Examples include temperature measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit, where the difference between 20 and 30 degrees represents the same amount of heat as the difference between 30 and 40 degrees. However, social class does not fit into this category because although it can be ranked, the intervals between ranks aren't equal or quantifiable.<br/><br/>The <b>Nominal</b> variable category includes variables that can be categorised but not ordered. Examples include gender (male or female) or blood type (A, B, AB, O). While social class can indeed be categorised like nominal variables, it also contains an inherent order (lower to middle to upper), thus making it more accurately described as ordinal.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Ratio</b> variables are similar to interval variables in that they have meaningful distances between measurements. However, ratio scales also have a clear definition of zero. Examples include age and weight. Social class does not meet these criteria because there's no absolute zero point for social class and differences between classes aren't uniformly measurable.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, social class best fits as an ordinal variable due to its ability to be both categorised and ordered with unequal intervals.<br/><br/></div>
