Stratification is a technique used during the analysis phase of a study to control for confounding. By categorizing data into subgroups (strata) that share a certain characteristic (such as age groups), researchers can analyse the effect of the treatment within each stratum to account for potential confounding variables.<br/><br/>Explanation for the Incorrect Answers:<br/><br/>Randomization: Randomization is used in the design phase of an experimental study, such as a randomized controlled trial, to evenly distribute confounding variables across all study groups. It is not a technique used during the analysis stage.<br/><br/>Matching: Matching is a technique used in the design phase of a study, especially in case-control studies, where cases are matched to controls based on certain confounding variables. It is not typically an analytic stage technique.<br/><br/>Linkage: Linkage refers to the process of connecting different sets of data from different sources based on common identifiers. While it can help in examining associations between exposures and outcomes, it is not a method for controlling confounding in the analysis.<br/><br/>Restriction of participants: This involves limiting the study to certain participants based on criteria that exclude potential confounders. This is also done at the design stage, not during the analysis.<br/></div>
