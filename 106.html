They have access to a database of deliveries going back many years.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>Retrospective cohort study</b> The most appropriate type of study design in this scenario would be a retrospective cohort study.<br/><br/>In a retrospective cohort study, the researcher would identify a group of individuals who were exposed to a particular factor or intervention (in this case, the use of forceps in delivery) and compare them to a group of individuals who were not exposed. The researcher would then assess the occurrence of schizophrenia in both groups by examining historical data from the database of deliveries.<br/><br/>This study design is suitable because the researcher already has access to a database of deliveries going back many years. By reviewing the historical data, they can identify individuals who were exposed to forceps during delivery and follow them over time to determine the incidence of schizophrenia. They can also establish a comparison group of individuals who were not exposed to forceps during delivery and assess the occurrence of schizophrenia in that group as well.<br/><br/>A case-control study, on the other hand, would be less appropriate in this case as it involves identifying individuals with the outcome (schizophrenia) and then comparing them to a control group without the outcome to determine the exposure (use of forceps). However, the researcher already knows the exposure (use of forceps), so a retrospective cohort study would be more suitable.<br/><br/>A prospective cohort study, while a valuable study design in general, would require following a group of individuals over time from the point of exposure (in this case, delivery) to assess the occurrence of schizophrenia. Since the researcher has access to historical data, a retrospective cohort study would be a more feasible and efficient approach.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><br/><table class="qbody" style="width:100%"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;width:35px"><b>123.</b></td><td>A researcher wants to know if a new psychological therapy is helpful in treatment of people with borderline personality disorder</td></tr><tr><td></td><td> Randomised control study This would require an interventional/ experimental study.
