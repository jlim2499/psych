<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>Which of the following is true of population parameters?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">The mean height of a population is an example of a parameter</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>The mean height of a population is an example of a parameter</b>. A parameter is a numerical characteristic or value that describes an entire population. Examples include the population mean, variance, or proportion. The mean height of a population is a classic example of a parameter, as it describes a feature of the whole population rather than a sample.<br/><br/><b>Parameters tend to have normal distributions</b> is incorrect. Parameters themselves are fixed values that describe a population and do not have distributions. However, estimates of parameters derived from samples (statistics) may follow certain distributions, such as a normal distribution under the Central Limit Theorem.<br/><br/><b>Parameters are the result of statistical tests</b> is incorrect. Parameters are inherent characteristics of the population and not derived from statistical tests. Statistical tests are used to estimate or make inferences about population parameters based on sample data.<br/><br/><b>Parameters are always whole numbers</b> is incorrect. Parameters can take on any value, whether whole numbers or decimals, depending on the variable being measured. For example, a population mean or proportion can often be a fractional value.<br/><br/><b>A parameter is a statistic</b> is incorrect. A parameter and a statistic are distinct. A parameter describes a population, whereas a statistic is a calculated value from a sample that is used to estimate a population parameter.<br/></div>
