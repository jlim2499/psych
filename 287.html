<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>The Hawthorne effect is most likely to affect studies on which of the following?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Compliance with antipsychotic medication</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Compliance with antipsychotic medication</b>. The Hawthorne effect describes changes in behaviour that occur as a result of individuals knowing they are being observed or studied. In studies of medication compliance, the Hawthorne effect can lead to an overestimation of compliance rates, as participants may modify their behaviour because they are aware of the observer's presence.<br/><br/><b>The effect of SSRIs on blood pressure</b> is incorrect because physiological measures like blood pressure are less likely to be influenced by the participant's awareness of being observed, as they are not typically within the individual's conscious control.<br/><br/><b>Mortality rates from CVA resulting from ADHD medication</b> is incorrect because mortality rates are objective outcomes that are not influenced by the Hawthorne effect; the occurrence of death is not changed by awareness of being observed.<br/><br/><b>Changes in bladder volume resulting from ketamine use</b> is also incorrect because this is a physiological measure that is unlikely to be influenced by awareness of being observed.<br/><br/><b>Seizure frequency following relaxation therapy</b> might be influenced by the Hawthorne effect, but it is not as direct an impact as compliance with medication. The frequency of seizures can be more variable and influenced by many factors, including the psychological state, which can be indirectly affected by the awareness of observation. However, compliance with medication is a behaviour that can be directly modified if the patient knows they are being monitored.<br/></div>
