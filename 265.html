<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>PDSA cycles are most relevant to which of the following?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Quality improvement</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Quality improvement</b>. The Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle is a fundamental tool used in quality improvement initiatives. It provides a systematic method for testing changes on a small scale before full implementation, ensuring that improvements are effective and sustainable. In clinical practice, PDSA cycles help healthcare teams to iteratively test and refine processes, leading to better patient outcomes and more efficient use of resources.<br/><br/><b>Audit</b>, while important in assessing compliance with established standards and identifying areas for improvement, is not the primary focus of PDSA cycles. Audits typically involve reviewing practices and outcomes retrospectively to ensure that healthcare delivery meets certain criteria, rather than actively testing and implementing changes.<br/><br/><b>Systematic reviews</b> are comprehensive analyses of existing research on a particular topic, aimed at synthesising evidence to guide clinical practice. Although valuable for informing quality improvement projects, systematic reviews do not utilise the iterative testing and refinement process characteristic of PDSA cycles.<br/><br/><b>Qualitative analyses</b> involve examining non-numeric data to understand experiences, perceptions, and behaviours. While qualitative insights can inform quality improvement initiatives, they are not a primary application of PDSA cycles, which focus more on testing and implementing specific changes in clinical processes.<br/><br/><b>Cost-benefit analyses</b> evaluate the economic impact of interventions by comparing their costs with the benefits they provide. Although such analyses can be part of broader quality improvement efforts, the PDSA cycle specifically addresses the practical aspects of implementing and refining changes in healthcare settings rather than purely economic evaluations.<br/></div>
