He introduced them as a pragmatic way to assist general practitioners (non-psychiatrists) in the identification of schizophrenia (Picardi, 2019).<br/><br/>The evidence suggests that they are not pathognomonic, but are highly suggestive of schizophrenia.  First rank symptoms are also seen in affective disorders and have also been reported in personality disorders.<br/><br/>The evidence does not support the claim that they are of any prognostic significance (Nordgaard 2008).<br/><br/>In a systematic review in 2015 the following was concluded (Soares-Weiser, 2015):<br/><br/>FRS differentiated schizophrenia from nonpsychotic mental health disorders with a sensitivity of 61.8% (51.7%-71%) and a specificity of 94.1% (88%-97.2%).<br/><br/>FRS differentiated schizophrenia from other types of psychosis with a sensitivity of 58% (50.3%-65.3%) and a specificity of 74.7% (65.2%-82.3%).<br/><br/>The first rank symptoms include:<br/><br/><ul><li>	Running commentary</li><li>	Thought echo</li><li>	Voices heard arguing</li><li>	Thought insertion</li><li>	Thought withdrawal</li><li>	Thought broadcast (thoughts are perceived as leaving the subject's head/mind)</li><li>	Delusional perception</li><li>	Somatic passivity</li><li>	Made affect (belief that feelings are controlled by an outside force)</li><li>	Made volition (belief that impulses and/or behaviour are controlled by an outside force)</li></ul><br/>References:<br/><br/><i>Norgaard (2008) The Diagnostic Status of First-Rank Symptoms.
