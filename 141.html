<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>The number of new cases of a disease that occur over a period of time is summarised by which of the following?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Cumulative incidence</span></div><br/>The correct answer is the <b>Cumulative incidence</b>. Cumulative incidence is a measure of the number of new cases of a disease that occur in a population over a specific period of time. It is a direct measure of the risk that an individual will develop the disease during that time period. This measure takes into account both the number of people who become ill and the time at which they become ill, thus providing information about the rate or speed at which new cases are occurring.<br/><br/>The <b>Prevalence rate</b>, on the other hand, represents not only new cases but also existing ones at a particular point in time. It gives an overall picture of how widespread a disease is within a population, regardless of when each case occurred. Therefore, it does not accurately reflect the number of new cases occurring over a specific period.<br/><br/><b>Period prevalence</b> is similar to prevalence rate but covers a defined period rather than a single point in time. It includes all cases (new and pre-existing) present during this period, so again it does not specifically represent new cases.<br/><br/><b>Attributable risk</b> refers to the difference in rates of disease between exposed and unexposed groups in observational studies; it provides an estimate of how much risk can be attributed to a certain exposure or factor. This term does not describe rates or counts of new diseases over time.<br/><br/>Finally, <b>Relative risk</b>, also known as risk ratio, compares the probability or risk of an event (e.g., developing a disease) happening in one group with that in another group. Relative risk does not provide information on absolute numbers or rates of new diseases over time but rather provides comparative information between different populations or groups.<br/><br/>In summary, while all these terms relate to epidemiology and measures associated with disease occurrence, cumulative incidence specifically summarises the number of new cases occurring over a specified period.<br/><br/></div>
