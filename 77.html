<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>In a dataset, if all the values are identical, which of the following is true?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">The variance and standard deviation are zero</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>The variance and standard deviation are zero</b>. If all the values in a dataset are identical, there is no variability among the values, meaning the variance and standard deviation (measures of spread) are both zero. This occurs because all differences from the mean are zero, resulting in no dispersion in the data.<br/><br/><b>The variance is maximum</b>: This is incorrect. Variance measures how far values are spread from the mean. When all values are identical, there is no spread, so variance is zero, not maximum.<br/><br/><b>The variance is negative</b>: This is incorrect. Variance cannot be negative because it is calculated as the average of squared differences from the mean, and squaring always results in non-negative values.<br/><br/><b>The standard deviation is undefined</b>: This is incorrect. The standard deviation is well-defined even when all values are identical. In this case, it equals zero because there is no variability.<br/><br/><b>The standard deviation is equal to the mean</b>: This is incorrect. The standard deviation measures variability and is unrelated to the mean when all values are identical. The standard deviation is zero in this case, regardless of the mean.<br/></div>
