In one study of 2,000 patients 1,200 received the new drug of which 120 patients develop gout. The remaining 800 patients received a placebo of which 200 developed gout. What is the absolute risk reduction of developing gout?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">15%</span></div><br/><div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">ARR = CER - EER</div>The correct answer is 15%.<br/><br/>The absolute risk reduction (ARR) is calculated by subtracting the event rate in the treatment group from the event rate in the control group. In this case:<br/><br/>The event rate (risk) in the placebo group (control event rate, CER) is 200/800 = 0.25 or 25%.<br/>The event rate (risk) in the treatment group (experimental event rate, EER) is 120/1200 = 0.1 or 10%.<br/><br/>ARR = CER - EER = 25% - 10% = 15%.<br/></div>
