If only one hand is drawn or they are not differentiated, no point is given.</li></ul></li><li>Correct time (10 past 11):<ul><li>The clock hands are set to the correct time (1 point).</li><li>Any other time or incorrect placement of the hands will result in no point for this category.</li></ul></li></ul><br/>Total Score:<br/><br/>The maximum score on the CDT is 5 points, with each of the five components earning 1 point.<br/><br/>Interpretation:<br/><br/>A score of 5 typically indicates normal cognitive function.<br/><br/>A score of 4 or lower suggests the possibility of cognitive impairment, with the types of errors made helping to distinguish between different causes, such as dementia or motor-related conditions like Parkinson's disease.<br/><br/>Some versions of the CDT use a 10-point scoring system, which breaks down the task into more detailed components (e.g., separating the placement of the numbers into quadrants or evaluating the relative lengths of the hands), but the 5-point system remains widely used due to its simplicity and clinical relevance.</div></div>
