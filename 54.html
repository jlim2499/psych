<div id="div_question"><link href="style1.css" rel="stylesheet"/>In evaluating a new depression scale, a psychiatrist finds that items measuring sadness, fatigue, and hopelessness are highly correlated with each other. Which form of reliability does this correlation best represent?<br/><div><br/><span style="background-color: #A5FF7F; padding: 11px 22px; border-radius: 4px; border-left: 5px solid green;">Internal consistency reliability</span></div><br/>The correct answer is <b>Internal consistency reliability</b>. Internal consistency reliability assesses the extent to which items within a test measure the same construct. In this case, high correlations between items measuring sadness, fatigue, and hopelessness suggest that they are consistently evaluating the same underlying construct of depression. A commonly used statistical measure for internal consistency is Cronbachâ€™s alpha, which quantifies how closely related items in a scale are.<br/><br/><b>Split-half reliability</b>: Split-half reliability involves dividing the test into two halves and comparing the results to check consistency. While it is a form of internal consistency, it does not specifically involve correlating items individually and is not as comprehensive as internal consistency reliability.<br/><br/><b>Parallel-forms reliability</b>: Parallel-forms reliability assesses the consistency between two equivalent forms of a test. It is unrelated to the correlation between items within a single form of a test, as it involves comparing results from two different versions.<br/><br/><b>Inter-rater reliability</b>: Inter-rater reliability measures the consistency of scores between different raters. This is relevant in scenarios where different clinicians or observers evaluate the same individual but does not apply to item correlations within a self-administered scale.<br/><br/><b>Test-retest reliability</b>: Test-retest reliability examines the stability of a test over time by administering it on two separate occasions. It does not involve analysing the correlation between items within a single administration.<br/></div>
