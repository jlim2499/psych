Wilson and Jungner's criteria, widely adopted in the UK, outline ten key principles that help determine whether a condition is suitable for screening.<br/><br/>1. The condition should be an important public health problem<br/><br/>2. There should be an acceptable treatment for patients with recognised disease<br/><br/>3. Facilities for diagnosis and treatment should be available<br/><br/>4. There should be a recognised latent or early symptomatic stage<br/><br/>5. The natural history of the condition, including its development from latent to declared disease should be adequately understood<br/><br/>6. There should be a suitable test or examination<br/><br/>7. The test or examination should be acceptable to the population<br/><br/>8. There should be agreed policy on whom to treat<br/><br/>9. The cost of case-finding (including diagnosis and subsequent treatment of patients) should be economically balanced in relation to the possible expenditure as a whole<br/><br/>10. Case-finding should be a continuous process and not a 'once and for all' project</div></div>
